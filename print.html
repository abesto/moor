<p>01/08/2022</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Brendan aka Slither. I've been coding in MOO on <a href="https://www.sindome.org/">Sindome</a> since 2003. I have spent many many hours over the years pouring over the original LambdaMOO programmers manual written by Pavel Curtis. In 2016 I set about updating the original manual with some of my learnings and it wasn't until 2019 that I finished work on it. Around the same time I heard about ToastStunt from <a href="https://github.com/lisdude">lisdude</a>. I wanted to get involved, but sadly, my C/++ coding skills are terrible. Thus, I decided my contribution would be to update the programmers guide to include all the changes that Toast has added, as well as further learnings and feedback from lisdude, DistantOrigin, and other members of the ToastStunt Discord server.</p>
<p>This guide is not just a technical document, it also contains opinions (mine and others) about what you should (waifs) and shouldn't (anonymous objects, multiple inheritance) consider doing and using. In the end though it's up to you. LambdaMOO and now its successor, ToastStunt, are amazing for creating games, hobby projects, and for tinkering or learning to code. I hope you have some fun!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-toaststunt"><a class="header" href="#what-is-toaststunt">What is ToastStunt?</a></h2>
<p>ToastStunt is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/toddsundsted/stunt">Stunt</a> which is a fork of of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">LambdaMOO</a>. At the time of this writing (01/01/22) ToastStunt was under active development. Stunt and LambdaMOO were not. If you are looking for an up to date, feature rich, LambdaMOO, then ToastStunt is for you. It incorporates much of the 'patches' that were released for legacy LambdaMOO, and much more (TLS, better
FileIO, updated and expanded built-ins functions, multiple inheritance, curl support, and threading to name a few).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>ToastStunt is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games, conferencing systems, and other collaborative software. Its most common use, however, is as a multi-participant, low-bandwidth virtual reality, and it is with this focus in mind that I describe it here.</p>
<p>Participants (usually referred to as <em>players</em>) connect to ToastStunt using a telnet, SSH, or specialized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD_client">mud client</a>. Upon connection, they are usually presented with a <em>welcome message</em> explaining how to either create a new <em>character</em> or connect to an existing one. Characters are the embodiment of players in the virtual reality that is ToastStunt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: No one really connects to a MOO using just a telnet client these days. MUD Clients are incredibly common, and can connect on the telnet (or SSH) port. See the resources section for more information on these. There are even some web based clients (<a href="https://github.com/JavaChilly/dome-client.js">dome-client</a>) out there that use websockets to connect to a MOO directly from the browser. And ToastStunt can be configured to offer secure connections using TLS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having connected to a character, players then give one-line commands that are parsed and interpreted by ToastStunt as appropriate. Such commands may cause changes in the virtual reality, such as the location of a character, or may simply report on the current state of that reality, such as the appearance of some object.</p>
<p>The job of interpreting those commands is shared between the two major components in the ToastStunt system: the <em>server</em> and the <em>database</em>. The server is a program, written in a standard programming language, that manages the network connections, maintains queues of commands and other tasks to be executed, controls all access to the database, and executes other programs written in the MOO programming language. The database contains representations of all the objects in the virtual reality, including the MOO programs that the server executes to give those objects their specific behaviors.</p>
<p>Almost every command is parsed by the server into a call on a MOO procedure, or <em>verb</em>, that actually does the work. Thus, programming in the MOO language is a central part of making non-trivial extensions to the database and thus, the virtual reality.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I describe the structure and contents of a ToastStunt database. The following chapter gives a complete description of how the server performs its primary duty: parsing the commands typed by players. Next, I describe the complete syntax and semantics of the MOO programming language. Finally, I describe all of the database conventions assumed by the server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: For the most part, this manual describes only those aspects of ToastStunt that are entirely independent of the contents of the database. It does not describe, for example, the commands or programming interfaces present in the ToastCore database. There are exceptions to this, for situations where it seems prudent to delve deeper into these areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-toaststunt-database"><a class="header" href="#the-toaststunt-database">The ToastStunt Database</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we describe in detail the various kinds of data that can appear in a ToastStunt database and that MOO programs can manipulate. In a few places, we refer to the <a href="https://github.com/lisdude/toastcore">ToastCore</a> database. This is one particular ToastStunt database which is under active development by the ToastStunt community.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="moo-value-types"><a class="header" href="#moo-value-types">MOO Value Types</a></h1>
<p>There are only a few kinds of values that MOO programs can manipulate:</p>
<ul>
<li>integers (in a specific, large range)</li>
<li>real numbers (represented with floating-point numbers)</li>
<li>strings (of characters)</li>
<li>object numbers (of the permanent objects in the database)</li>
<li>object references (to the anonymous objects in the database)</li>
<li>bools</li>
<li>WAIFs</li>
<li>errors (arising during program execution)</li>
<li>lists (of all of the above, including lists)</li>
<li>maps (of all of the above, including lists and maps)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integer-type"><a class="header" href="#integer-type">Integer Type</a></h2>
<p>ToastStunt supports 64 bit integers, but it can also be configured to support 32 bit. In MOO programs, integers are written just as you see them here, an optional minus sign followed by a non-empty sequence of decimal digits. In particular, you may not put commas, periods, or spaces in the middle of large integers, as we sometimes do in English and other natural languages (e.g. 2,147,483,647).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The values $maxint and $minint define in the database the maximum integers supported. These are set automatically with ToastCore. If you are migrating from LambdaMOO it is still a good idea to check that these numbers are being set properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="real-number-type"><a class="header" href="#real-number-type">Real Number Type</a></h2>
<p>Real numbers in MOO are represented as they are in almost all other programming languages, using so-called <em>floating-point</em> numbers. These have certain (large) limits on size and precision that make them useful for a wide range of applications. Floating-point numbers are written with an optional minus sign followed by a non-empty sequence of digits punctuated at some point with a decimal point '.' and/or followed by a scientific-notation marker (the letter 'E' or 'e' followed by an optional sign and one or more digits). Here are some examples of floating-point numbers:</p>
<pre><code>325.0   325.  3.25e2   0.325E3   325.E1   .0325e+4   32500e-2
</code></pre>
<p>All of these examples mean the same number. The third of these, as an example of scientific notation, should be read "3.25 times 10 to the power of 2".</p>
<p>Fine point: The MOO represents floating-point numbers using the local meaning of the C-language <code>double</code> type, which is almost always equivalent to IEEE 754 double precision floating point. If so, then the smallest positive floating-point number is no larger than <code>2.2250738585072014e-308</code> and the largest floating-point number is <code>1.7976931348623157e+308</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>IEEE infinities and NaN values are not allowed in MOO.</li>
<li>The error <code>E_FLOAT</code> is raised whenever an infinity would otherwise be computed.</li>
<li>The error <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised whenever a NaN would otherwise arise.</li>
<li>The value <code>0.0</code> is always returned on underflow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="string-type"><a class="header" href="#string-type">String Type</a></h2>
<p>Character <em>strings</em> are arbitrarily-long sequences of normal, ASCII printing characters. When written as values in a program, strings are enclosed in double-quotes, like this:</p>
<pre><code>"This is a character string."
</code></pre>
<p>To include a double-quote in the string, precede it with a backslash (<code>\</code>), like this:</p>
<pre><code>"His name was \"Leroy\", but nobody ever called him that."
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, to include a backslash in a string, double it:</p>
<pre><code>"Some people use backslash ('\\') to mean set difference."
</code></pre>
<p>MOO strings may not include special ASCII characters like carriage-return, line-feed, bell, etc. The only non-printing characters allowed are spaces and tabs.</p>
<p>Fine point: There is a special kind of string used for representing the arbitrary bytes used in general, binary input and output. In a <em>binary string</em>, any byte that isn't an ASCII printing character or the space character is represented as the three-character substring "~XX", where XX is the hexadecimal representation of the byte; the input character '~' is represented by the three-character substring "~7E". This special representation is used by the functions <code>encode_binary()</code> and <code>decode_binary()</code> and by the functions <code>notify()</code> and <code>read()</code> with network connections that are in binary mode. See the descriptions of the <code>set_connection_option()</code>, <code>encode_binary()</code>, and <code>decode_binary()</code> functions for more details.</p>
<p>MOO strings can be 'indexed into' using square braces and an integer index (much the same way you can with lists):</p>
<pre><code>"this is a string"[4] -&gt; "s"
</code></pre>
<p>There is syntactic sugar that allows you to do:</p>
<pre><code>"Sli" in "Slither"
</code></pre>
<p>as a shortcut for the index() built-in function.</p>
<h2 id="object-type"><a class="header" href="#object-type">Object Type</a></h2>
<p><em>Objects</em> are the backbone of the MOO database and, as such, deserve a great deal of discussion; the entire next section is devoted to them. For now, let it suffice to say that every object has a number, unique to that object.</p>
<p>In programs, we write a reference to a particular object by putting a hash mark (<code>#</code>) followed by the number, like this:</p>
<pre><code>#495
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Referencing object numbers in your code should be discouraged. An object only exists until it is recycled. It is technically possible for an object number to change under some circumstances. Thus, you should use a corified reference to an object ($my_special_object) instead. More on corified references later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Object numbers are always integers.</p>
<p>There are three special object numbers used for a variety of purposes: <code>#-1</code>, <code>#-2</code>, and <code>#-3</code>, usually referred to in the ToastCore database as <code>$nothing</code>, <code>$ambiguous_match</code>, and <code>$failed_match</code>, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="anonymous-object-type"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-object-type">Anonymous Object Type</a></h2>
<p>Anonymous Objects are references and do not have an object number. They are created by passing the optional third argument to <code>create()</code>. Anonymous objects are automatically garbage collected when there is no longer any references to them (in your code or in properties).</p>
<p>We will go into more detail on Anonymous Objects in the <a href="the-toaststunt-database/moo-value-types.html#working-with-anonymous-objects">Working with Anonymous Objects</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="bool-type"><a class="header" href="#bool-type">Bool Type</a></h2>
<p><em>bools</em> are either true or false. Eg: <code>my_bool = true; my_second_bool = false;</code>. In MOO <code>true</code> evaluates to <code>1</code> and <code>false</code> evaluates to <code>0</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>false == 0 evaluates to true
true  == 1 evaluates to true
false == 1 evaluates to false
true  == 0 evaluates to false
true  == 5 evaluates to false
false == -43 evaluates to false
</code></pre>
<h2 id="waif-type"><a class="header" href="#waif-type">WAIF Type</a></h2>
<p><em>WAIFs</em> are lightweight objects. A WAIF is a value which you can store in a property or a variable or inside a LIST or another WAIF. A WAIF is smaller in size (measured in bytes) than a regular object, and it is faster to create and destroy. It is also reference counted, which means it is destroyed automatically when it is no longer in use. An empty WAIF is 72 bytes, empty list is 64 bytes. A WAIF will always be 8 bytes larger than a LIST (on 64bit, 4 bytes on 32bit) with the same values in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: WAIFs are not truly objects and don't really function like one. You can't manipulate a WAIF without basically recreating a normal object (and then what's the point?). It may be better to think of a WAIF as another data type. It's closer to being a list than it is to being an object. But that's semantics, really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WAIFs are smaller than typical objects, and faster to create. A WAIF has two builtin OBJ properties, .class and .owner. A WAIF is only ever going to be 4 bytes larger than a LIST with the same values.</p>
<p>OBJs grow by value_bytes(value) - value_bytes(0) for every property you set (that is, every property which becomes non-clear and takes on its own value distinct from the parent). LISTs and WAIFs both grow by value_bytes(value) for each new list element (in a LIST) or each property you set (in a WAIF). So a WAIF is never more than 4 bytes larger than a LIST which holds the same values, except WAIFs give each value a name (property name) but LISTs only give them numbers.</p>
<p>Essentially you should consider a WAIF as something you can make thousands of in a verb without a second thought. You might make a mailing list with 1000 messages, each a WAIF (instead of a LIST) but you most likely wouldn't use 1000 objects.</p>
<p>You create and destroy OBJs explicitly with the builtins create() and recycle() (or allocate them from a pool using verbs in the core). They stay around no matter what you do until you destroy them.</p>
<p>All of the other types you use in MOO (that require allocated memory) are reference counted. However you create them, they stay around as long as you keep them in a property or a variable somewhere, and when they are no longer used, they silently disappear, and you can't get them back.</p>
<p>We will go into more detail on WAIFs in the <a href="the-toaststunt-database/moo-value-types.html#working-with-waifs">Working with WAIFs</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="error-type"><a class="header" href="#error-type">Error Type</a></h2>
<p><em>Errors</em> are, by far, the least frequently used values in MOO. In the normal case, when a program attempts an operation that is erroneous for some reason (for example, trying to add a number to a character string), the server stops running the program and prints out an error message. However, it is possible for a program to stipulate that such errors should not stop execution; instead, the server should just let the value of the operation be an error value. The program can then test for such a result and take some appropriate kind of recovery action. In programs, error values are written as words beginning with <code>E_</code>. The complete list of error values, along with their associated messages, is as follows:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Error</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>E_NONE</td><td>No error</td></tr>
<tr><td>E_TYPE</td><td>Type mismatch</td></tr>

<h2 id="list-type"><a class="header" href="#list-type">List Type</a></h2>
<p>Another important value in MOO programs is <em>lists</em>. A list is a sequence of arbitrary MOO values, possibly including other lists. In programs, lists are written in mathematical set notation with each of the elements written out in order, separated by commas, the whole enclosed in curly braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>). For example, a list of the names of the days of the week is written like this:</p>
<pre><code>{"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
 "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: It doesn't matter that we put a line-break in the middle of the list. This is true in general in MOO: anywhere that a space can go, a line-break can go, with the same meaning. The only exception is inside character strings, where line-breaks are not allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="map-type"><a class="header" href="#map-type">Map Type</a></h2>
<p>The final type in MOO is a <em>map</em>. It is sometimes called a hashmap, associative array, or dictionary in other programming languages. A map is written as a set of key -&gt; value pairs, for example: <code>["key" -&gt; "value", 0 -&gt; {}, #15840 -&gt; []]</code>. Keys must be unique.</p>
<p>The key of a map can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>string</li>
<li>integer</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>error</li>
<li>float</li>
<li>anonymous object (not recommended)</li>
<li>waif</li>
<li>bool</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of a map can be any valid MOO type including another map.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Finding a value in a list is BigO(n) as a it uses a linear search. Maps are much more effective and are BigO(1) for retrieving a specific value by key.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="objects-in-the-moo-database"><a class="header" href="#objects-in-the-moo-database">Objects in the MOO Database</a></h1>
<p>There are anonymous objects and permanent objects in ToastStunt. Throughout this guide when we discuss <code>objects</code> we are typically referring to <code>permanent objects</code> and not <code>anonymous objects</code>. When discussing anonymous objects we will call them out specifically.</p>
<p>Objects encapsulate state and behavior – as they do in other object-oriented programming languages. Permanent objects are also used to represent objects in the virtual reality, like people, rooms, exits, and other concrete things. Because of this, MOO makes a bigger deal out of creating objects than it does for other kinds of values, like integers.</p>
<p>Numbers always exist, in a sense; you have only to write them down in order to operate on them. With permanent objects, it is different. The permanent object with number <code>#958</code> does not exist just because you write down its number. An explicit operation, the <code>create()</code> function described later, is required to bring a permanent object into existence. Once created, permanent objects continue to exist until they are explicitly destroyed by the <code>recycle()</code> function (also described later).</p>
<p>Anonymous objects, which are also created using <code>create()</code>, will continue to exist until the <code>recycle()</code> function is called or until there are no more references to the anonymous object.</p>
<p>The identifying number associated with a permanent object is unique to that object. It was assigned when the object was created and will never be reused unless <code>recreate()</code> or <code>reset_max_object()</code> are called. Thus, if we create an object and it is assigned the number <code>#1076</code>, the next object to be created (using <code>create()</code> will be assigned <code>#1077</code>, even if <code>#1076</code> is destroyed in the meantime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The above limitation led to design of systems to manage object reuse. The <code>$recycler</code> is one example of such a system. This is <strong>not</strong> present in the <code>minimal.db</code> which is included in the ToastStunt source, however it is present in the latest dump of the <a href="https://github.com/lisdude/toastcore">ToastCore DB</a> which is the recommended starting point for new development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous and permanent objects are made up of three kinds of pieces that together define its behavior: <em>attributes</em>, <em>properties</em>, and <em>verbs</em>.</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-object-attributes"><a class="header" href="#fundamental-object-attributes">Fundamental Object Attributes</a></h2>
<p>There are three fundamental <em>attributes</em> to every object:</p>
<ol>
<li>A flag representing the built-in properties allotted to the object.</li>
<li>A list of object that are its parents</li>
<li>A list of the objects that are its <em>children</em>; that is, those objects for which this object is their parent.</li>
</ol>
<p>The act of creating a character sets the player attribute of an object and only a wizard (using the function <code>set_player_flag()</code>) can change that setting. Only characters have the player bit set to 1. Only permanent objects can be players.</p>
<p>The parent/child hierarchy is used for classifying objects into general classes and then sharing behavior among all members of that class. For example, the ToastCore database contains an object representing a sort of "generic" room. All other rooms are <em>descendants</em> (i.e., children or children's children, or ...) of that one. The generic room defines those pieces of behavior that are common to all rooms; other rooms specialize that behavior for their own purposes. The notion of classes and specialization is the very essence of what is meant by <em>object-oriented</em> programming.</p>
<p>Only the functions <code>create()</code>, <code>recycle()</code>, <code>chparent()</code>, <code>chparents()</code>, <code>renumber()</code> and <code>recreate()</code> can change the parent and children attributes.</p>
<p>Below is the table representing the <code>flag</code> for the built-in properties allotted to the object. This is simply a representation of bits, and for example, the player flag is a singular bit (0x01). So the flag is actually an integer that, when in binary, represents all of the flags on the object.</p>
<pre><code>Player:         0x01    set_player_flag()
Programmer:     0x02    .programmer
Wizard:         0x04    .wizard
Obsolete_1:     0x08    *csssssh*
Read:           0x10    .r
Write:          0x20    .w
Obsolete_2:     0x40    *csssssh*
Fertile:        0x80    .f
Anonymous:      0x100   .a
Invalid:        0x200   &lt;destroy anonymous object&gt;
Recycled:       0x400   &lt;destroy anonymous object and call recycle verb&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="properties-on-objects"><a class="header" href="#properties-on-objects">Properties on Objects</a></h2>
<p>A <em>property</em> is a named "slot" in an object that can hold an arbitrary MOO value. Every object has eleven built-in properties whose values are constrained to be of particular types. In addition, an object can have any number of other properties, none of which have type constraints. The built-in properties are as follows:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>name</td><td>a string, the usual name for this object</td></tr>
<tr><td>owner</td><td>an object, the player who controls access to it</td></tr>
<tr><td>location</td><td>an object, where the object is in virtual reality</td></tr>
<tr><td>contents</td><td>a list of objects, the inverse of location</td></tr>
<tr><td>last_move</td><td>a map of an object's last location and the time() it moved</td></tr>
<tr><td>programmer</td><td>a bit, does the object have programmer rights?</td></tr>
<tr><td>wizard</td><td>a bit, does the object have wizard rights?</td></tr>
<tr><td>r</td><td>a bit, is the object publicly readable?</td></tr>
<tr><td>w</td><td>a bit, is the object publicly writable?</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td><td>a bit, is the object fertile?</td></tr>
<tr><td>a</td><td>a bit, can this be a parent of anonymous objects?</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The <code>name</code> property is used to identify the object in various printed messages. It can only be set by a wizard or by the owner of the object. For player objects, the <code>name</code> property can only be set by a wizard; this allows the wizards, for example, to check that no two players have the same name.</p>
<p>The <code>owner</code> identifies the object that has owner rights to this object, allowing them, for example, to change the <code>name</code> property. Only a wizard can change the value of this property.</p>
<p>The <code>location</code> and <code>contents</code> properties describe a hierarchy of object containment in the virtual reality. Most objects are located "inside" some other object and that other object is the value of the <code>location</code> property.</p>
<p>The <code>contents</code> property is a list of those objects for which this object is their location. In order to maintain the consistency of these properties, only the <code>move()</code> function is able to change them.</p>
<p>The <code>last_move</code> property is a map in the form <code>["source" -&gt; OBJ, "time" -&gt; TIMESTAMP]</code>. This is set by the server each time an object is moved.</p>
<p>The <code>wizard</code> and <code>programmer</code> bits are only applicable to characters, objects representing players. They control permission to use certain facilities in the server. They may only be set by a wizard.</p>
<p>The <code>r</code> bit controls whether or not players other than the owner of this object can obtain a list of the properties or verbs in the object.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, the <code>w</code> bit controls whether or not non-owners can add or delete properties and/or verbs on this object. The <code>r</code> and <code>w</code> bits can only be set by a wizard or by the owner of the object.</p>
<p>The <code>f</code> bit specifies whether or not this object is <em>fertile</em>, whether or not players other than the owner of this object can create new objects with this one as the parent. It also controls whether or not non-owners can use the <code>chparent()</code> or <code>chparents()</code> built-in function to make this object the parent of an existing object. The <code>f</code> bit can only be set by a wizard or by the owner of the object.</p>
<p>The <code>a</code> bit specifies whether or not this object can be used as a parent of an anonymous object created by a player other than the owner of this object. It works similarly to the <code>f</code> bit, but governs the creation of anonymous objects only.</p>
<p>All of the built-in properties on any object can, by default, be read by any player. It is possible, however, to override this behavior from within the database, making any of these properties readable only by wizards. See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is possible, and very useful, for objects to have other properties aside from the built-in ones. These can come from two sources.</p>
<p>First, an object has a property corresponding to every property in its parent object. To use the jargon of object-oriented programming, this is a kind of <em>inheritance</em>. If some object has a property named <code>foo</code>, then so will all of its children and thus its children's children, and so on.</p>
<p>Second, an object may have a new property defined only on itself and its descendants. For example, an object representing a rock might have properties indicating its weight, chemical composition, and/or pointiness, depending upon the uses to which the rock was to be put in the virtual reality.</p>
<p>Every defined property (as opposed to those that are built-in) has an owner and a set of permissions for non-owners. The owner of the property can get and set the property's value and can change the non-owner permissions. Only a wizard can change the owner of a property.</p>
<p>The initial owner of a property is the player who added it; this is usually, but not always, the player who owns the object to which the property was added. This is because properties can only be added by the object owner or a wizard, unless the object is publicly writable (i.e., its <code>w</code> property is 1), which is rare. Thus, the owner of an object may not necessarily be the owner of every (or even any) property on that object.</p>
<p>The permissions on properties are drawn from this set:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Permission Bit</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>r</code></td><td>Read permission lets non-owners get the value of the property</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>w</code></td><td>Write permission lets non-owners set the property value</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>c</code></td><td>Change ownership in descendants</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The <code>c</code> bit is a bit more complicated. Recall that every object has all of the properties that its parent does and perhaps some more. Ordinarily, when a child object inherits a property from its parent, the owner of the child becomes the owner of that property. This is because the <code>c</code> permission bit is "on" by default. If the <code>c</code> bit is not on, then the inherited property has the same owner in the child as it does in the parent.</p>
<p>As an example of where this can be useful, the ToastCore database ensures that every player has a <code>password</code> property containing the encrypted version of the player's connection password. For security reasons, we don't want other players to be able to see even the encrypted version of the password, so we turn off the <code>r</code> permission bit. To ensure that the password is only set in a consistent way (i.e., to the encrypted version of a player's password), we don't want to let anyone but a wizard change the property. Thus, in the parent object for all players, we made a wizard the owner of the password property and set the permissions to the empty string, <code>""</code>. That is, non-owners cannot read or write the property and, because the <code>c</code> bit is not set, the wizard who owns the property on the parent class also owns it on all of the descendants of that class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: In classic LambdaMOO only the first 8 characters of a password were hashed. In practice this meant that the passwords <code>password</code> and <code>password12345</code> were exactly the same and either one can be used to login. This was fixed in ToastStunt. If you are upgrading from LambdaMOO, you will need to log in with only the first 8 characters of the password (and then reset your password to something more secure).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another, perhaps more down-to-earth example arose when a character named Ford started building objects he called "radios" and another character, yduJ, wanted to own one. Ford kindly made the generic radio object fertile, allowing yduJ to create a child object of it, her own radio. Radios had a property called <code>channel</code> that identified something corresponding to the frequency to which the radio was tuned. Ford had written nice programs on radios (verbs, discussed below) for turning the channel selector on the front of the radio, which would make a corresponding change in the value of the <code>channel</code> property. However, whenever anyone tried to turn the channel selector on yduJ's radio, they got a permissions error. The problem concerned the ownership of the <code>channel</code> property.</p>
<p>As explained later, programs run with the permissions of their author. So, in this case, Ford's nice verb for setting the channel ran with his permissions. But, since the <code>channel</code> property in the generic radio had the <code>c</code> permission bit set, the <code>channel</code> property on yduJ's radio was owned by her. Ford didn't have permission to change it! The fix was simple. Ford changed the permissions on the <code>channel</code> property of the generic radio to be just <code>r</code>, without the <code>c</code> bit, and yduJ made a new radio. This time, when yduJ's radio inherited the <code>channel</code> property, yduJ did not inherit ownership of it; Ford remained the owner. Now the radio worked properly, because Ford's verb had permission to change the channel.</p>
<h2 id="verbs-on-objects"><a class="header" href="#verbs-on-objects">Verbs on Objects</a></h2>
<p>The final kind of piece making up an object is <em>verbs</em>. A verb is a named MOO program that is associated with a particular object. Most verbs implement commands that a player might type; for example, in the ToastCore database, there is a verb on all objects representing containers that implements commands of the form <code>put object in container</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible for MOO programs to invoke the verbs defined on objects. Some verbs, in fact, are designed to be used only from inside MOO code; they do not correspond to any particular player command at all. Thus, verbs in MOO are like the <em>procedures</em> or <em>methods</em> found in some other programming languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There are even more ways to refer to <em>verbs</em> and their counterparts in other programming language: <em>procedure</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>subroutine</em>, <em>subprogram</em>, and <em>method</em> are the primary ones. However, in <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> abbreviated <em>OOP</em> you may primarily know them as methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with properties, every verb has an owner and a set of permission bits. The owner of a verb can change its program, its permission bits, and its argument specifiers (discussed below). Only a wizard can change the owner of a verb.</p>
<p>The owner of a verb also determines the permissions with which that verb runs; that is, the program in a verb can do whatever operations the owner of that verb is allowed to do and no others. Thus, for example, a verb owned by a wizard must be written very carefully, since wizards are allowed to do just about anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: This is serious business. The MOO has a variety of checks in place for permissions (at the object, verb and property levels) that are all but ignored when a verb is executing with a wizard's permissions. You may want to create a non-wizard character and give them the programmer bit, and write much of your code there, leaving the wizard bit for things that actually require access to everything, despite permissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Permission Bit</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>r (read)</td><td>Let non-owners see the verb code</td></tr>
<tr><td>w (write)</td><td>Let non-owners write the verb code</td></tr>
<tr><td>x (execute)</td><td>Let verb be invoked from within another verb</td></tr>
<tr><td>d (debug)</td><td>Let the verb raise errors to be caught</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The permission bits on verbs are drawn from this set: <code>r</code> (read), <code>w</code> (write), <code>x</code> (execute), and <code>d</code> (debug). Read permission lets non-owners see the program for a verb and, symmetrically, write permission lets them change that program. The other two bits are not, properly speaking, permission bits at all; they have a universal effect, covering both the owner and non-owners.</p>
<p>The execute bit determines whether or not the verb can be invoked from within a MOO program (as opposed to from the command line, like the <code>put</code> verb on containers). If the <code>x</code> bit is not set, the verb cannot be called from inside a program. This is most obviously useful for <code>this none this</code> verbs which are intended to be executed from within other verb programs, however, it may be useful to set the <code>x</code> bit on verbs that are intended to be executed from the command line, as then those can also
be executed from within another verb.</p>
<p>The setting of the debug bit determines what happens when the verb's program does something erroneous, like subtracting a number from a character string. If the <code>d</code> bit is set, then the server <em>raises</em> an error value; such raised errors can be <em>caught</em> by certain other pieces of MOO code. If the error is not caught, however, the server aborts execution of the command and, by default, prints an error message on the terminal of the player whose command is being executed. (See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details on how uncaught errors are handled.) If the <code>d</code> bit is not set, then no error is raised, no message is printed, and the command is not aborted; instead the error value is returned as the result of the erroneous operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>d</code> bit exists only for historical reasons; it used to be the only way for MOO code to catch and handle errors. With the introduction of the <code>try</code> -<code>except</code> statement and the error-catching expression, the <code>d</code> bit is no longer useful. All new verbs should have the <code>d</code> bit set, using the newer facilities for error handling if desired. Over time, old verbs written assuming the <code>d</code> bit would not be set should be changed to use the new facilities instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to an owner and some permission bits, every verb has three <em>argument specifiers</em>, one each for the <code>direct object</code>, the <code>preposition</code>, and the <code>indirect object</code>. The direct and indirect specifiers are each drawn from this set: <code>this</code>, <code>any</code>, or <code>none</code>. The preposition specifier is <code>none</code>, <code>any</code>, or one of the items in this list:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Preposition</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>with/using</td></tr>

</div>
<p>The argument specifiers are used in the process of parsing commands, described in the next chapter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-built-in-command-parser"><a class="header" href="#the-built-in-command-parser">The Built-in Command Parser</a></h1>
<p>The MOO server is able to do a small amount of parsing on the commands that a player enters. In particular, it can break apart commands that follow one of the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>verb</li>
<li>verb direct-object</li>
<li>verb direct-object preposition indirect-object</li>
</ul>
<p>Real examples of these forms, meaningful in the ToastCore database, are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>look
take yellow bird
put yellow bird in cuckoo clock
</code></pre>
<p>Note that English articles (i.e., <code>the</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>an</code>) are not generally used in MOO commands; the parser does not know that they are not important parts of objects' names.</p>
<p>To have any of this make real sense, it is important to understand precisely how the server decides what to do when a player types a command.</p>
<p>But first, we mention the three situations in which a line typed by a player is not treated as an ordinary command:</p>
<ol>
<li>The line may exactly match the connection's defined flush command, if any (<code>.flush</code> by default), in which case all pending lines of input are cleared and nothing further is done with the flush command itself. Likewise, any line may be flushed by a subsequent flush command before the server otherwise gets a chance to process it. For more on this, see Flushing Unprocessed Input.</li>
<li>The line may begin with a prefix that qualifies it for out-of-band processing and thence, perhaps, as an out-of-band command. For more on this, see Out-of-band Processing.</li>
<li>The connection may be subject to a read() call (see section Operations on Network Connections) or there may be a .program command in progress (see section The .program Command), either of which will consume the line accordingly. Also note that if connection option "hold-input" has been set, all in-band lines typed by the player are held at this point for future reading, even if no reading task is currently active.</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, we (finally) have an actual command line that can undergo normal command parsing as follows:</p>
<p>The server checks whether or not the first non-blank character in the command is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"</code></li>
<li><code>:</code></li>
<li><code>;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If so, that character is replaced by the corresponding command below, followed by a space:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>say</code></li>
<li><code>emote</code></li>
<li><code>eval</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For example this command:</p>
<pre><code>"Hi, there.
</code></pre>
<p>will be treated exactly as if it were as follows:</p>
<pre><code>say Hi, there.
</code></pre>
<p>The server next breaks up the command into words. In the simplest case, the command is broken into words at every run of space characters; for example, the command <code>foo bar baz</code> would be broken into the words <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code>. To force the server to include spaces in a "word", all or part of a word can be enclosed in double-quotes. For example, the command:</p>
<pre><code>foo "bar mumble" baz" "fr"otz" bl"o"rt
</code></pre>
<p>is broken into the words <code>foo</code>, <code>bar mumble</code>, <code>baz frotz</code>, and <code>blort</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, to include a double-quote or a backslash in a word, they can be preceded by a backslash, just like in MOO strings.</p>
<p>Having thus broken the string into words, the server next checks to see if the first word names any of the six "built-in" commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.program</code></li>
<li><code>PREFIX</code></li>
<li><code>OUTPUTPREFIX</code></li>
<li><code>SUFFIX</code></li>
<li><code>OUTPUTSUFFIX</code></li>
<li>or the connection's defined <em>flush</em> command, if any (<code>.flush</code> by default).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one of these is only available to programmers, the next four are intended for use by client programs, and the last can vary from database to database or even connection to connection; all six are described in the final chapter of this document, "Server Commands and Database Assumptions". If the first word isn't one of the above, then we get to the usual case: a normal MOO command.</p>
<p>The server next gives code in the database a chance to handle the command. If the verb <code>$do_command()</code> exists, it is called with the words of the command passed as its arguments and <code>argstr</code> set to the raw command typed by the user. If <code>$do_command()</code> does not exist, or if that verb-call completes normally (i.e., without suspending or aborting) and returns a false value, then the built-in command parser is invoked to handle the command as described below. Otherwise, it is assumed that the database code handled the command completely and no further action is taken by the server for that command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <code>$do_command</code> is a corified reference. It refers to the verb <code>do_command</code> on #0. More details on corifying properties and verbs are presented later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the built-in command parser is invoked, the server tries to parse the command into a verb, direct object, preposition and indirect object. The first word is taken to be the verb. The server then tries to find one of the prepositional phrases listed at the end of the previous section, using the match that occurs earliest in the command. For example, in the very odd command <code>foo as bar to baz</code>, the server would take <code>as</code> as the preposition, not <code>to</code>.</p>
<p>If the server succeeds in finding a preposition, it considers the words between the verb and the preposition to be the direct object and those after the preposition to be the indirect object. In both cases, the sequence of words is turned into a string by putting one space between each pair of words. Thus, in the odd command from the previous paragraph, there are no words in the direct object (i.e., it is considered to be the empty string, <code>""</code>) and the indirect object is <code>"bar to baz"</code>.</p>
<p>If there was no preposition, then the direct object is taken to be all of the words after the verb and the indirect object is the empty string.</p>
<p>The next step is to try to find MOO objects that are named by the direct and indirect object strings.</p>
<p>First, if an object string is empty, then the corresponding object is the special object <code>#-1</code> (aka <code>$nothing</code> in ToastCore). If an object string has the form of an object number (i.e., a hash mark (<code>#</code>) followed by digits), and the object with that number exists, then that is the named object. If the object string is either <code>"me"</code> or <code>"here"</code>, then the player object itself or its location is used, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: $nothing is considered a <code>corified</code> object. This means that a <em>property</em> has been created on <code>#0</code> named <code>nothing</code> with the value of <code>#-1</code>. For example (after creating the property): <code>;#0.nothing = #-1</code> This allows you to reference the <code>#-1</code> object via it's corified reference of <code>$nothing</code>. In practice this can be very useful as you can use corified references in your code (and should!) instead of object numbers. Among other benefits this allows you to write your code (which references other objects) once and then swap out the corified reference, pointing to a different object. For instance if you have a new error logging system and you want to replace the old $error_logger reference with your new one, you wont have to find all the references to the old error logger object number in your code. You can just change the property on <code>#0</code> to reference the new object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, the server considers all of the objects whose location is either the player (i.e., the objects the player is "holding", so to speak) or the room the player is in (i.e., the objects in the same room as the player); it will try to match the object string against the various names for these objects.</p>
<p>The matching done by the server uses the <code>aliases</code> property of each of the objects it considers. The value of this property should be a list of strings, the various alternatives for naming the object. If it is not a list, or the object does not have an <code>aliases</code> property, then the empty list is used. In any case, the value of the <code>name</code> property is added to the list for the purposes of matching.</p>
<p>The server checks to see if the object string in the command is either exactly equal to or a prefix of any alias; if there are any exact matches, the prefix matches are ignored. If exactly one of the objects being considered has a matching alias, that object is used. If more than one has a match, then the special object <code>#-2</code> (aka <code>$ambiguous_match</code> in ToastCore) is used. If there are no matches, then the special object <code>#-3</code> (aka <code>$failed_match</code> in ToastCore) is used.</p>
<p>So, now the server has identified a verb string, a preposition string, and direct- and indirect-object strings and objects. It then looks at each of the verbs defined on each of the following four objects, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>the player who typed the command</li>
<li>the room the player is in</li>
<li>the direct object, if any</li>
<li>the indirect object, if any.</li>
</ol>
<p>For each of these verbs in turn, it tests if all of the the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>the verb string in the command matches one of the names for the verb</li>
<li>the direct- and indirect-object values found by matching are allowed by the corresponding <em>argument specifiers</em> for the verb</li>
<li>the preposition string in the command is matched by the <em>preposition specifier</em> for the verb.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll explain each of these criteria in turn.</p>
<p>Every verb has one or more names; all of the names are kept in a single string, separated by spaces. In the simplest case, a verb-name is just a word made up of any characters other than spaces and stars (i.e., ' ' and <code>*</code>). In this case, the verb-name matches only itself; that is, the name must be matched exactly.</p>
<p>If the name contains a single star, however, then the name matches any prefix of itself that is at least as long as the part before the star. For example, the verb-name <code>foo*bar</code> matches any of the strings <code>foo</code>, <code>foob</code>, <code>fooba</code>, or <code>foobar</code>; note that the star itself is not considered part of the name.</p>
<p>If the verb name <em>ends</em> in a star, then it matches any string that begins with the part before the star. For example, the verb-name <code>foo*</code> matches any of the strings <code>foo</code>, <code>foobar</code>, <code>food</code>, or <code>foogleman</code>, among many others. As a special case, if the verb-name is <code>*</code> (i.e., a single star all by itself), then it matches anything at all.</p>
<p>Recall that the argument specifiers for the direct and indirect objects are drawn from the set <code>none</code>, <code>any</code>, and <code>this</code>. If the specifier is <code>none</code>, then the corresponding object value must be <code>#-1</code> (aka <code>$nothing</code> in ToastCore); that is, it must not have been specified. If the specifier is <code>any</code>, then the corresponding object value may be anything at all. Finally, if the specifier is <code>this</code>, then the corresponding object value must be the same as the object on which we found this verb; for example, if we are considering verbs on the player, then the object value must be the player object.</p>
<p>Finally, recall that the argument specifier for the preposition is either <code>none</code>, <code>any</code>, or one of several sets of prepositional phrases, given above. A specifier of <code>none</code> matches only if there was no preposition found in the command. A specifier of <code>any</code> always matches, regardless of what preposition was found, if any. If the specifier is a set of prepositional phrases, then the one found must be in that set for the specifier to match.</p>
<p>So, the server considers several objects in turn, checking each of their verbs in turn, looking for the first one that meets all of the criteria just explained. If it finds one, then that is the verb whose program will be executed for this command. If not, then it looks for a verb named <code>huh</code> on the room that the player is in; if one is found, then that verb will be called. This feature is useful for implementing room-specific command parsing or error recovery. If the server can't even find a <code>huh</code> verb to run, it prints an error message like <code>I couldn't understand that.</code> and the command is considered complete.</p>
<p>At long last, we have a program to run in response to the command typed by the player. When the code for the program begins execution, the following built-in variables will have the indicated values:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>player</td><td>an object, the player who typed the command</td></tr>
<tr><td>this</td><td>an object, the object on which this verb was found</td></tr>
<tr><td>caller</td><td>an object, the same as <code>player</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>verb</td><td>a string, the first word of the command</td></tr>
<tr><td>argstr</td><td>a string, everything after the first word of the command</td></tr>

<tr><td>iobjstr</td><td>a string, the indirect object string</td></tr>
<tr><td>iobj</td><td>an object, the indirect object value</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The value returned by the program, if any, is ignored by the server.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="threading"><a class="header" href="#threading">Threading</a></h1>
<p>ToastStunt is single threaded, but it utilizes a threading library (extension-background) to allow certain server functions to run in a separate thread. To protect the database, these functions will implicitly suspend the MOO code (similar to how read() operates).</p>
<p>It is possible to disable threading of functions for a particular verb by calling <code>set_thread_mode(0)</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: By default, ToastStunt has threading enabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are configurable options for the background subsystem which can be defined in <code>options.h</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TOTAL_BACKGROUND_THREADS</code> is the total number of pthreads that will be created at runtime to process background MOO tasks.</li>
<li><code>DEFAULT_THREAD_MODE</code> dictates the default behavior of threaded MOO functions without a call to set_thread_mode. When set to true, the default behavior is to thread these functions, requiring a call to set_thread_mode(0) to disable. When false, the default behavior is unthreaded and requires a call to set_thread_mode(1) to enable threading for the functions in that verb.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you execute a threaded built-in in your code, your code is suspended. For this reason care should be taken in how and when you use these functions with threading enabled.</p>
<p>Functions that support threading, and functions for utilizing threading such as <code>thread_pool</code> are discussed in the built-ins section.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-moo-programming-language"><a class="header" href="#the-moo-programming-language">The MOO Programming Language</a></h1>
<p>MOO stands for "MUD, Object Oriented." MUD, in turn, has been said to stand for many different things, but I tend to think of it as "Multi-User Dungeon" in the spirit of those ancient precursors to MUDs, Adventure and Zork.</p>
<p>MOO, the programming language, is a relatively small and simple object-oriented language designed to be easy to learn for most non-programmers; most complex systems still require some significant programming ability to accomplish, however.</p>
<p>Having given you enough context to allow you to understand exactly what MOO code is doing, I now explain what MOO code looks like and what it means. I begin with the syntax and semantics of expressions, those pieces of code that have values. After that, I cover statements, the next level of structure up from expressions. Next, I discuss the concept of a task, the kind of running process initiated by players entering commands, among other causes. Finally, I list all of the built-in functions available to MOO code and describe what they do.</p>
<p>First, though, let me mention comments. You can include bits of text in your MOO program that are ignored by the server. The idea is to allow you to put in notes to yourself and others about what the code is doing. To do this, begin the text of the comment with the two characters <code>/*</code> and end it with the two characters <code>*/</code>; this is just like comments in the C programming language. Note that the server will completely ignore that text; it will <em>not</em> be saved in the database. Thus, such comments are only useful in files of code that you maintain outside the database.</p>
<p>To include a more persistent comment in your code, try using a character string literal as a statement. For example, the sentence about peanut butter in the following code is essentially ignored during execution but will be maintained in the database:</p>
<pre><code>for x in (players())
  "Grendel eats peanut butter!";
  player:tell(x.name, " (", x, ")");
endfor
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In practice, the only style of comments you will use is quoted strings of text. Get used to it. Another thing of note is that these strings ARE evaluated. Nothing is done with the results of the evaluation, because the value is not stored anywhere-- however, it may be prudent to keep string comments out of nested loops to make your code a bit faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="moo-language-expressions"><a class="header" href="#moo-language-expressions">MOO Language Expressions</a></h1>
<p>Expressions are those pieces of MOO code that generate values; for example, the MOO code</p>
<pre><code>3 + 4
</code></pre>
<p>is an expression that generates (or "has" or "returns") the value 7. There are many kinds of expressions in MOO, all of them discussed below.</p>
<h2 id="errors-while-evaluating-expressions"><a class="header" href="#errors-while-evaluating-expressions">Errors While Evaluating Expressions</a></h2>
<p>Most kinds of expressions can, under some circumstances, cause an error to be generated. For example, the expression <code>x / y</code> will generate the error <code>E_DIV</code> if <code>y</code> is equal to zero. When an expression generates an error, the behavior of the server is controlled by setting of the <code>d</code> (debug) bit on the verb containing that expression. If the <code>d</code> bit is not set, then the error is effectively squelched immediately upon generation; the error value is simply returned as the value of the expression that generated it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This error-squelching behavior is very error prone, since it affects <em>all</em> errors, including ones the programmer may not have anticipated. The <code>d</code> bit exists only for historical reasons; it was once the only way for MOO programmers to catch and handle errors. The error-catching expression and the <code>try</code> -<code>except</code> statement, both described below, are far better ways of accomplishing the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the <code>d</code> bit is set, as it usually is, then the error is <em>raised</em> and can be caught and handled either by code surrounding the expression in question or by verbs higher up on the chain of calls leading to the current verb. If the error is not caught, then the server aborts the entire task and, by default, prints a message to the current player. See the descriptions of the error-catching expression and the <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement for the details of how errors can be caught, and the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details on the handling of uncaught errors.</p>
<h2 id="writing-values-directly-in-verbs"><a class="header" href="#writing-values-directly-in-verbs">Writing Values Directly in Verbs</a></h2>
<p>The simplest kind of expression is a literal MOO value, just as described in the section on values at the beginning of this document. For example, the following are all expressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>17</code></li>
<li><code>#893</code></li>
<li><code>"This is a character string."</code></li>
<li><code>E_TYPE</code></li>
<li><code>["key" -&gt; "value"]</code></li>
<li><code>{"This", "is", "a", "list", "of", "words"}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of lists, like the last example above, note that the list expression contains other expressions, several character strings in this case. In general, those expressions can be of any kind at all, not necessarily literal values. For example,</p>
<pre><code>{3 + 4, 3 - 4, 3 * 4}
</code></pre>
<p>is an expression whose value is the list <code>{7, -1, 12}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="naming-values-within-a-verb"><a class="header" href="#naming-values-within-a-verb">Naming Values Within a Verb</a></h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, it is possible to store values in properties on objects; the properties will keep those values forever, or until another value is explicitly put there. Quite often, though, it is useful to have a place to put a value for just a little while. MOO provides local variables for this purpose.</p>
<p>Variables are named places to hold values; you can get and set the value in a given variable as many times as you like. Variables are temporary, though; they only last while a particular verb is running; after it finishes, all of the variables given values there cease to exist and the values are forgotten.</p>
<p>Variables are also "local" to a particular verb; every verb has its own set of them. Thus, the variables set in one verb are not visible to the code of other verbs.</p>
<p>The name for a variable is made up entirely of letters, digits, and the underscore character (<code>_</code>) and does not begin with a digit. The following are all valid variable names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>foo</code></li>
<li><code>_foo</code></li>
<li><code>this2that</code></li>
<li><code>M68000</code></li>
<li><code>two_words</code></li>
<li><code>This_is_a_very_long_multiword_variable_name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, along with almost everything else in MOO, the case of the letters in variable names is insignificant. For example, these are all names for the same variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fubar</code></li>
<li><code>Fubar</code></li>
<li><code>FUBAR</code></li>
<li><code>fUbAr</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A variable name is itself an expression; its value is the value of the named variable. When a verb begins, almost no variables have values yet; if you try to use the value of a variable that doesn't have one, the error value <code>E_VARNF</code> is raised. (MOO is unlike many other programming languages in which one must <em>declare</em> each variable before using it; MOO has no such declarations.) The following variables always have values:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>INT</td></tr>
<tr><td>NUM</td></tr>
<tr><td>FLOAT</td></tr>
<tr><td>OBJ</td></tr>
<tr><td>STR</td></tr>

<tr><td>iobjstr</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <code>num</code> is a deprecated reference to <code>int</code> and has been presented only for completeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The values of some of these variables always start out the same:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>INT</code></td><td>0</td><td>an integer, the type code for integers</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NUM</code></td><td>0</td><td>(deprecated) an integer, the type code for integers</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>WAIF</code></td><td>13</td><td>an integer, the type code for WAIF values</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>true</code></td><td>true</td><td>the boolean true</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>false</code></td><td>false</td><td>the boolean false</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>typeof</code> function can is of note here and is described in the built-ins section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For others, the general meaning of the value is consistent, though the value itself is different for different situations:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>player</code></td><td>an object, the player who typed the command that started the task that involved running this piece of code.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>this</code></td><td>an object, the object on which the currently-running verb was found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>caller</code></td><td>an object, the object on which the verb that called the currently-running verb was found. For the first verb called for a given command, <code>caller</code> has the same value as <code>player</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>verb</code></td><td>a string, the name by which the currently-running verb was identified.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>args</code></td><td>a list, the arguments given to this verb. For the first verb called for a given command, this is a list of strings, the words on the command line.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The rest of the so-called "built-in" variables are only really meaningful for the first verb called for a given command. Their semantics is given in the discussion of command parsing, above.</p>
<p>To change what value is stored in a variable, use an <em>assignment</em> expression:</p>
<pre><code>variable = expression
</code></pre>
<p>For example, to change the variable named <code>x</code> to have the value 17, you would write <code>x = 17</code> as an expression. An assignment expression does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>it changes the value of of the named variable</li>
<li>it returns the new value of that variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the expression</p>
<pre><code>13 + (x = 17)
</code></pre>
<p>changes the value of <code>x</code> to be 17 and returns 30.</p>
<h2 id="arithmetic-operators"><a class="header" href="#arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic Operators</a></h2>
<p>All of the usual simple operations on numbers are available to MOO programs:</p>
<pre><code>+
-
*
/
%
</code></pre>
<p>These are, in order, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. In the following table, the expressions on the left have the corresponding values on the right:</p>
<pre><code>5 + 2       =&gt;   7
5 - 2       =&gt;   3
5 * 2       =&gt;   10
5 / 2       =&gt;   2
5.0 / 2.0   =&gt;   2.5
5 % 2       =&gt;   1
5.0 % 2.0   =&gt;   1.0
5 % -2      =&gt;   1
-5 % 2      =&gt;   -1
-5 % -2     =&gt;   -1
-(5 + 2)    =&gt;   -7
</code></pre>
<p>Note that integer division in MOO throws away the remainder and that the result of the remainder operator (<code>%</code>) has the same sign as the left-hand operand. Also, note that <code>-</code> can be used without a left-hand operand to negate a numeric expression.</p>
<p>Fine point: Integers and floating-point numbers cannot be mixed in any particular use of these arithmetic operators; unlike some other programming languages, MOO does not automatically coerce integers into floating-point numbers. You can use the <code>tofloat()</code> function to perform an explicit conversion.</p>
<p>The <code>+</code> operator can also be used to append two strings. The expression</p>
<p><code>"foo" + "bar"</code></p>
<p>has the value <code>"foobar"</code></p>
<p>The <code>+</code> operator can also be used to append two lists. The expression</p>
<pre><code>{1, 2, 3} + {4, 5, 6}
</code></pre>
<p>has the value <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</code></p>
<p>The <code>+</code> operator can also be used to append to a list. The expression</p>
<pre><code>{1, 2} + #123
</code></pre>
<p>has the value of <code>{1, 2, #123}</code>
Unless both operands to an arithmetic operator are numbers of the same kind (or, for <code>+</code>, both strings), the error value <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. If the right-hand operand for the division or remainder operators (<code>/</code> or <code>%</code>) is zero, the error value <code>E_DIV</code> is raised.</p>
<p>MOO also supports the exponentiation operation, also known as "raising to a power," using the <code>^</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>3 ^ 4       =&gt;   81
3 ^ 4.5     error--&gt;   E_TYPE
3.5 ^ 4     =&gt;   150.0625
3.5 ^ 4.5   =&gt;   280.741230801382
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: if the first operand is an integer, then the second operand must also be an integer. If the first operand is a floating-point number, then the second operand can be either kind of number. Although it is legal to raise an integer to a negative power, it is unlikely to be terribly useful.</p>

<h2 id="bitwise-operators"><a class="header" href="#bitwise-operators">Bitwise Operators</a></h2>

<h2 id="comparing-values"><a class="header" href="#comparing-values">Comparing Values</a></h2>
<p>Any two values can be compared for equality using <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>. The first of these returns 1 if the two values are equal and 0 otherwise; the second does the reverse:</p>
<pre><code>3 == 4                              =&gt;  0
3 != 4                              =&gt;  1
3 == 3.0                            =&gt;  0
"foo" == "Foo"                      =&gt;  1
#34 != #34                          =&gt;  0
{1, #34, "foo"} == {1, #34, "FoO"}  =&gt;  1
E_DIV == E_TYPE                     =&gt;  0
3 != "foo"                          =&gt;  1
[1 -&gt; 2] == [1 -&gt; 2]                =&gt;  1
[1 -&gt; 2] == [2 -&gt; 1]                =&gt;  0
true == true                        =&gt;  1
false == true                       =&gt;  0
</code></pre>
<p>Note that integers and floating-point numbers are never equal to one another, even in the <em>obvious</em> cases. Also note that comparison of strings (and list values containing strings) is case-insensitive; that is, it does not distinguish between the upper- and lower-case version of letters. To test two values for case-sensitive equality, use the <code>equal</code> function described later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: It is easy (and very annoying) to confuse the equality-testing operator (<code>==</code>) with the assignment operator (<code>=</code>), leading to nasty, hard-to-find bugs. Don't do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Comparing floating point numbers for equality can be tricky. Sometimes two floating point numbers will appear the same but be rounded up or down at some meaningful bit, and thus will not be exactly equal. This is especially true when comparing a number in memory (assigned to a variable) to a number that is formed from reading a value from a player, or pulled from a property. Be wary of this, if you ever encounter it, as it can be tedious to debug.</p>

<p>Integers, floats, object numbers, strings, and error values can also be compared for ordering purposes using the following operators:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>&lt;</td><td>meaning "less than"</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;=</td><td>"less than or equal"</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;=</td><td>"greater than or equal"</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;</td><td>"greater than"</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As with the equality operators, these return 1 when their operands are in the appropriate relation and 0 otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>3 &lt; 4           =&gt;  1
3 &lt; 4.0         =&gt;  E_TYPE (an error)
#34 &gt;= #32      =&gt;  1
"foo" &lt;= "Boo"  =&gt;  0
E_DIV &gt; E_TYPE  =&gt;  1
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, as with the equality operators, strings are compared case-insensitively. To perform a case-sensitive string comparison, use the <code>strcmp</code> function described later. Also note that the error values are ordered as given in the table in the section on values. If the operands to these four comparison operators are of different types (even integers and floating-point numbers are considered different types), or if they are lists, then <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised.</p>
<h2 id="values-as-true-and-false"><a class="header" href="#values-as-true-and-false">Values as True and False</a></h2>
<p>There is a notion in MOO of <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> values; every value is one or the other. The true values are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>all integers other than zero (positive or negative)</li>
<li>all floating-point numbers not equal to <code>0.0</code></li>
<li>all non-empty strings (i.e., other than <code>""</code>)</li>
<li>all non-empty lists (i.e., other than <code>{}</code>)</li>
<li>all non-empty maps (i.e, other than <code>[]</code>)</li>
<li>the bool 'true'</li>
</ul>
<p>All other values are false:</p>
<ul>
<li>the integer zero</li>
<li>the floating-point numbers <code>0.0</code> and <code>-0.0</code></li>
<li>the empty string (<code>""</code>)</li>
<li>the empty list (<code>{}</code>)</li>
<li>all object numbers &amp; object references</li>
<li>all error values</li>
<li>the bool 'false'</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Objects are considered false. If you need to evaluate if a value is of the type object, you can use <code>typeof(potential_object) == OBJ</code> however, keep in mind that this does not mean that the object referenced actually exists. IE: #100000000 will return true, but that does not mean that object exists in your MOO.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Don't get confused between values evaluating to true or false, and the boolean values of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four kinds of expressions and two kinds of statements that depend upon this classification of MOO values. In describing them, I sometimes refer to the <em>truth value</em> of a MOO value; this is just <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>, the category into which that MOO value is classified.</p>
<p>The conditional expression in MOO has the following form:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1 ? expression-2 | expression-3
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This is commonly referred to as a ternary statement in most programming languages. In MOO the commonly used ! is replaced with a |.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, expression-1 is evaluated. If it returns a true value, then expression-2 is evaluated and whatever it returns is returned as the value of the conditional expression as a whole. If expression-1 returns a false value, then expression-3 is evaluated instead and its value is used as that of the conditional expression.</p>
<pre><code>1 ? 2 | 3           =&gt;  2
0 ? 2 | 3           =&gt;  3
"foo" ? 17 | {#34}  =&gt;  17
</code></pre>
<p>Note that only one of expression-2 and expression-3 is evaluated, never both.</p>
<p>To negate the truth value of a MOO value, use the <code>!</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>! expression
</code></pre>
<p>If the value of expression is true, <code>!</code> returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1:</p>
<pre><code>! "foo"     =&gt;  0
! (3 &gt;= 4)  =&gt;  1
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The "negation" or "not" operator is commonly referred to as "bang" in modern parlance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is frequently useful to test more than one condition to see if some or all of them are true. MOO provides two operators for this:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1 &amp;&amp; expression-2
expression-1 || expression-2
</code></pre>
<p>These operators are usually read as "and" and "or," respectively.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator first evaluates expression-1. If it returns a true value, then expression-2 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> expression as a whole; otherwise, the value of expression-1 is used as the value of the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> expression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: expression-2 is only evaluated if expression-1 returns a true value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> expression is equivalent to the conditional expression:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1 ? expression-2 | expression-1
</code></pre>
<p>except that expression-1 is only evaluated once.</p>
<p>The <code>||</code> operator works similarly, except that expression-2 is evaluated only if expression-1 returns a false value. It is equivalent to the conditional expression:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1 ? expression-1 | expression-2
</code></pre>
<p>except that, as with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, expression-1 is only evaluated once.</p>
<p>These two operators behave very much like "and" and "or" in English:</p>
<pre><code>1 &amp;&amp; 1                  =&gt;  1
0 &amp;&amp; 1                  =&gt;  0
0 &amp;&amp; 0                  =&gt;  0
1 || 1                  =&gt;  1
0 || 1                  =&gt;  1
0 || 0                  =&gt;  0
17 &lt;= 23  &amp;&amp;  23 &lt;= 27  =&gt;  1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="indexing-into-lists-maps-and-strings"><a class="header" href="#indexing-into-lists-maps-and-strings">Indexing into Lists, Maps and Strings</a></h2>
<p>Strings, lists, and maps can be seen as ordered sequences of MOO values. In the case of strings, each is a sequence of single-character strings; that is, one can view the string <code>"bar"</code> as a sequence of the strings <code>"b"</code>, <code>"a"</code>, and <code>"r"</code>. MOO allows you to refer to the elements of lists, maps, and strings by number, by the <em>index</em> of that element in the list or string. The first element has index 1, the second has index 2, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: It is very important to note that unlike many programming languages (which use 0 as the starting index), MOO uses 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="extracting-an-element-by-index"><a class="header" href="#extracting-an-element-by-index">Extracting an Element by Index</a></h3>
<p>The indexing expression in MOO extracts a specified element from a list, map, or string:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1[expression-2]
</code></pre>
<p>First, expression-1 is evaluated; it must return a list, map, or string (the <em>sequence</em>). Then, expression-2 is evaluated and must return an integer (the <em>index</em>) or the <em>key</em> in the case of maps. If either of the expressions returns some other type of value, <code>E_TYPE</code> is returned.</p>
<p>For lists and strings the index must be between 1 and the length of the sequence, inclusive; if it is not, then <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised. The value of the indexing expression is the index'th element in the sequence. For maps, the key must be present, if it is not, then E_RANGE is raised. Within expression-2 you can use the symbol ^ as an expression returning the index or key of the first element in the sequence and you can use the symbol $ as an expression returning the index or key of the last element in expression-1.</p>
<pre><code>"fob"[2]                =&gt;  "o"
[1 -&gt; "A"][1]           =&gt;  "A"
"fob"[1]                =&gt;  "f"
{#12, #23, #34}[$ - 1]  =&gt;  #23
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are no legal indices for the empty string or list, since there are no integers between 1 and 0 (the length of the empty string or list).</p>
<p>Fine point: The ^ and $ expressions return the first/last index/key of the expression just before the nearest enclosing [...] indexing or subranging brackets. For example:</p>
<pre><code>"frob"[{3, 2, 4}[^]]     =&gt;  "o"
"frob"[{3, 2, 4}[$]]     =&gt;  "b"
</code></pre>
<p>is possible because $ in this case represents the 3rd index of the list next to it, which evaluates to the value 4, which in turn is applied as the index to the string, which evaluates to the b.</p>
<h3 id="replacing-an-element-of-a-list-map-or-string"><a class="header" href="#replacing-an-element-of-a-list-map-or-string">Replacing an Element of a List, Map, or String</a></h3>
<p>It often happens that one wants to change just one particular slot of a list or string, which is stored in a variable or a property. This can be done conveniently using an <em>indexed assignment</em> having one of the following forms:</p>
<pre><code>variable[index-expr] = result-expr
object-expr.name[index-expr] = result-expr
object-expr.(name-expr)[index-expr] = result-expr
$name[index-expr] = result-expr
</code></pre>
<p>The first form writes into a variable, and the last three forms write into a property. The usual errors (<code>E_TYPE</code>, <code>E_INVIND</code>, <code>E_PROPNF</code> and <code>E_PERM</code> for lack of read/write permission on the property) may be raised, just as in reading and writing any object property; see the discussion of object property expressions below for details.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, if variable does not yet have a value (i.e., it has never been assigned to), <code>E_VARNF</code> will be raised.</p>
<p>If index-expr is not an integer (for lists and strings) or is a collection value (for maps), or if the value of <code>variable</code> or the property is not a list, map or string, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. If <code>result-expr</code> is a string, but not of length 1, E_INVARG is raised. Suppose <code>index-expr</code> evaluates to a value <code>k</code>. If <code>k</code> is an integer and is outside the range of the list or string (i.e. smaller than 1 or greater than the length of the list or string), <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised. If <code>k</code> is not a valid key of the map, <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised. Otherwise, the actual assignment takes place.</p>
<p>For lists, the variable or the property is assigned a new list that is identical to the original one except at the k-th position, where the new list contains the result of result-expr instead. Likewise for maps, the variable or the property is assigned a new map that is identical to the original one except for the k key, where the new map contains the result of result-expr instead. For strings, the variable or the property is assigned a new string that is identical to the original one, except the k-th character is changed to be result-expr.</p>
<p>If index-expr is not an integer, or if the value of variable or the property is not a list or string, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. If result-expr is a string, but not of length 1, <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. Now suppose index-expr evaluates to an integer n. If n is outside the range of the list or string (i.e. smaller than 1 or greater than the length of the list or string), <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised. Otherwise, the actual assignment takes place.</p>
<p>For lists, the variable or the property is assigned a new list that is identical to the original one except at the n-th position, where the new list contains the result of result-expr instead. For strings, the variable or the property is assigned a new string that is identical to the original one, except the n-th character is changed to be result-expr.</p>
<p>The assignment expression itself returns the value of result-expr. For the following examples, assume that <code>l</code> initially contains the list <code>{1, 2, 3}</code>, that <code>m</code> initially contains the map <code>["one" -&gt; 1, "two" -&gt; 2]</code> and that <code>s</code> initially contains the string "foobar":</p>
<pre><code>l[5] = 3          =&gt;   E_RANGE (error)
l["first"] = 4    =&gt;   E_TYPE  (error)
s[3] = "baz"      =&gt;   E_INVARG (error)
l[2] = l[2] + 3   =&gt;   5
l                 =&gt;   {1, 5, 3}
l[2] = "foo"      =&gt;   "foo"
l                 =&gt;   {1, "foo", 3}
s[2] = "u"        =&gt;   "u"
s                 =&gt;   "fuobar"
s[$] = "z"        =&gt;   "z"
s                 =&gt;   "fuobaz"
m                 =&gt;   ["foo" -&gt; "bar"]
m[1] = "baz"      =&gt;   ["foo" -&gt; "baz"]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: (error) is only used for formatting and identification purposes in these examples and is not present in an actual raised error on the MOO.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>$</code> expression may also be used in indexed assignments with the same meaning as before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fine point: After an indexed assignment, the variable or property contains a <em>new</em> list or string, a copy of the original list in all but the n-th place, where it contains a new value. In programming-language jargon, the original list is not mutated, and there is no aliasing. (Indeed, no MOO value is mutable and no aliasing ever occurs.)</p>
<p>In the list and map case, indexed assignment can be nested to many levels, to work on nested lists and maps. Assume that <code>l</code> initially contains the following</p>
<pre><code>{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, "foo", ["bar" -&gt; "baz"]}
</code></pre>
<p>in the following examples:</p>
<pre><code>l[7] = 4             =&gt;   E_RANGE (error)
l[1][8] = 35         =&gt;   E_RANGE (error)
l[3][2] = 7          =&gt;   E_TYPE (error)
l[1][1][1] = 3       =&gt;   E_TYPE (error)
l[2][2] = -l[2][2]   =&gt;   -5
l                    =&gt;   {{1, 2, 3}, {4, -5, 6}, "foo", ["bar" -&gt; "baz"]}
l[2] = "bar"         =&gt;   "bar"
l                    =&gt;   {{1, 2, 3}, "bar", "foo", ["bar" -&gt; "baz"]}
l[2][$] = "z"        =&gt;   "z"
l                    =&gt;   {{1, 2, 3}, "baz", "foo", ["bar" -&gt; "baz"]}
l[$][^] = #3         =&gt;   #3
l                    =&gt;   {{1, 2, 3}, "baz", "foo", ["bar" -&gt; #3]}
</code></pre>
<p>The first two examples raise E_RANGE because 7 is out of the range of <code>l</code> and 8 is out of the range of <code>l[1]</code>. The next two examples raise <code>E_TYPE</code> because <code>l[3]</code> and <code>l[1][1]</code> are not lists.</p>

<p>The range expression extracts a specified subsequence from a list, map or string:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1[expression-2..expression-3]
</code></pre>
<p>The three expressions are evaluated in order. Expression-1 must return a list, map or string (the <em>sequence</em>) and the other two expressions must return integers (the <em>low</em> and <em>high</em> indices, respectively) for lists and strings, or non-collection values (the <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> keys in the ordered map, respectively) for maps; otherwise, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. The <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> expression can be used in either or both of expression-2 and expression-3 just as before.</p>
<p>If the low index is greater than the high index, then the empty string, list or map is returned, depending on whether the sequence is a string, list or map. Otherwise, both indices must be between 1 and the length of the sequence (for lists or strings) or valid keys (for maps); <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised if they are not. A new list, map or string is returned that contains just the elements of the sequence with indices between the low/high and high/end bounds.</p>

<p>The subrange assignment replaces a specified subsequence of a list, map or string with a supplied subsequence. The allowed forms are:</p>

<p>As with indexed assignments, the first form writes into a variable, and the last three forms write into a property. The same errors (<code>E_TYPE</code>, <code>E_INVIND</code>, <code>E_PROPNF</code> and <code>E_PERM</code> for lack of read/write permission on the property) may be raised. If variable does not yet have a value (i.e., it has never been assigned to), <code>E_VARNF</code> will be raised. As before, the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> expression can be used in either start-index-expr or end-index-expr.</p>
<p>If start-index-expr or end-index-expr is not an integer (for lists and strings) or a collection value (for maps), if the value of variable or the property is not a list, map, or string, or result-expr is not the same type as variable or the property, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. For lists and strings, <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised if end-index-expr is less than zero or if start-index-expr is greater than the length of the list or string plus one. Note: the length of result-expr does not need to be the same as the length of the specified range. For maps, <code>E_RANGE</code> is raised if <code>start-index-expr</code> or <code>end-index-expr</code> are not keys in the map.</p>
<p>In precise terms, the subrange assignment</p>
<pre><code>v[start..end] = value

<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>v = {@v[1..start - 1], @value, @v[end + 1..$]}

<p>if v is a list and to</p>
<pre><code>v = v[1..start - 1] + value + v[end + 1..$]

<p>There is no literal representation of the operation if v is a map. In this case the range given by start-index-expr and end-index-expr is removed, and the the values in result-expr are added.</p>

<h2 id="other-operations-on-lists"><a class="header" href="#other-operations-on-lists">Other Operations on Lists</a></h2>
<p>As was mentioned earlier, lists can be constructed by writing a comma-separated sequence of expressions inside curly braces:</p>
<pre><code>{expression-1, expression-2, ..., expression-N}
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting list has the value of expression-1 as its first element, that of expression-2 as the second, etc.</p>
<pre><code>{3 &lt; 4, 3 &lt;= 4, 3 &gt;= 4, 3 &gt; 4}  =&gt;  {1, 1, 0, 0}
</code></pre>
<p>The addition operator works with lists. When adding two lists together, the two will be concatenated:</p>
<pre><code>{1, 2, 3} + {4, 5, 6} =&gt; {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
</code></pre>
<p>When adding another type to a list, it will append that value to the end of the list:</p>
<pre><code>{1, 2} + #123 =&gt; {1, 2, #123}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, one may precede any of these expressions by the splicing operator, <code>@</code>. Such an expression must return a list; rather than the old list itself becoming an element of the new list, all of the elements of the old list are included in the new list. This concept is easy to understand, but hard to explain in words, so here are some examples. For these examples, assume that the variable <code>a</code> has the value <code>{2, 3, 4}</code> and that <code>b</code> has the value <code>{"Foo", "Bar"}</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{1, a, 5}   =&gt;  {1, {2, 3, 4}, 5}
{1, @a, 5}  =&gt;  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{a, @a}     =&gt;  {{2, 3, 4}, 2, 3, 4}
{@a, @b}    =&gt;  {2, 3, 4, "Foo", "Bar"}
</code></pre>
<p>If the splicing operator (<code>@</code>) precedes an expression whose value is not a list, then <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised as the value of the list construction as a whole.</p>
<p>The list membership expression tests whether or not a given MOO value is an element of a given list and, if so, with what index:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1 in expression-2
</code></pre>
<p>Expression-2 must return a list; otherwise, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. If the value of expression-1 is in that list, then the index of its first occurrence in the list is returned; otherwise, the <code>in</code> expression returns 0.</p>
<pre><code>2 in {5, 8, 2, 3}               =&gt;  3
7 in {5, 8, 2, 3}               =&gt;  0
"bar" in {"Foo", "Bar", "Baz"}  =&gt;  2
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the list membership operator is case-insensitive in comparing strings, just like the comparison operators. To perform a case-sensitive list membership test, use the <code>is_member</code> function described later. Note also that since it returns zero only if the given value is not in the given list, the <code>in</code> expression can be used either as a membership test or as an element locator.</p>

<p>It is often the case in MOO programming that you will want to access the elements of a list individually, with each element stored in a separate variables. This desire arises, for example, at the beginning of almost every MOO verb, since the arguments to all verbs are delivered all bunched together in a single list. In such circumstances, you <em>could</em> write statements like these:</p>
<pre><code>first = args[1];
second = args[2];
if (length(args) &gt; 2)
  third = args[3];
else
  third = 0;
endif
</code></pre>
<p>This approach gets pretty tedious, both to read and to write, and it's prone to errors if you mistype one of the indices. Also, you often want to check whether or not any <em>extra</em> list elements were present, adding to the tedium.</p>
<p>MOO provides a special kind of assignment expression, called <em>scattering assignment</em> made just for cases such as these. A scattering assignment expression looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{target, ...} = expr
</code></pre>
<p>where each target describes a place to store elements of the list that results from evaluating expr. A target has one of the following forms:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Target</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>variable</code></td><td>This is the simplest target, just a simple variable; the list element in the corresponding position is assigned to the variable. This is called a <em>required</em> target, since the assignment is required to put one of the list elements into the variable.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>?variable</code></td><td>This is called an <em>optional</em> target, since it doesn't always get assigned an element. If there are any list elements left over after all of the required targets have been accounted for (along with all of the other optionals to the left of this one), then this variable is treated like a required one and the list element in the corresponding position is assigned to the variable. If there aren't enough elements to assign one to this target, then no assignment is made to this variable, leaving it with whatever its previous value was.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>?variable = default-expr</code></td><td>This is also an optional target, but if there aren't enough list elements available to assign one to this target, the result of evaluating default-expr is assigned to it instead. Thus, default-expr provides a <em>default value</em> for the variable. The default value expressions are evaluated and assigned working from left to right <em>after</em> all of the other assignments have been performed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>@variable</code></td><td>By analogy with the <code>@</code> syntax in list construction, this variable is assigned a list of all of the 'leftover' list elements in this part of the list after all of the other targets have been filled in. It is assigned the empty list if there aren't any elements left over. This is called a <em>rest</em> target, since it gets the rest of the elements. There may be at most one rest target in each scattering assignment expression.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If there aren't enough list elements to fill all of the required targets, or if there are more than enough to fill all of the required and optional targets but there isn't a rest target to take the leftover ones, then <code>E_ARGS</code> is raised.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how this works. Assume first that the verb <code>me:foo()</code> contains the following code:</p>
<pre><code>b = c = e = 17;
{a, ?b, ?c = 8, @d, ?e = 9, f} = args;
return {a, b, c, d, e, f};
</code></pre>
<p>Then the following calls return the given values:</p>
<pre><code>me:foo(1)                        =&gt;   E_ARGS (error)
me:foo(1, 2)                     =&gt;   {1, 17, 8, {}, 9, 2}
me:foo(1, 2, 3)                  =&gt;   {1, 2, 8, {}, 9, 3}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4)               =&gt;   {1, 2, 3, {}, 9, 4}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)            =&gt;   {1, 2, 3, {}, 4, 5}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)         =&gt;   {1, 2, 3, {4}, 5, 6}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)      =&gt;   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5}, 6, 7}
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)   =&gt;   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5, 6}, 7, 8}
</code></pre>
<p>Using scattering assignment, the example at the beginning of this section could be rewritten more simply, reliably, and readably:</p>
<pre><code>{first, second, ?third = 0} = args;
</code></pre>
<p>Fine point: If you are familiar with JavaScript, the 'rest' and 'spread' functionality should look pretty familiar. It is good MOO programming style to use a scattering assignment at the top of nearly every verb (at least ones that are 'this none this'), since it shows so clearly just what kinds of arguments the verb expects.</p>
<h2 id="operations-on-bools"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-bools">Operations on BOOLs</a></h2>
<p>ToastStunt offers a <code>bool</code> type. This type can be either <code>true</code> which is considered <code>1</code> or <code>false</code> which is considered <code>0</code>. Boolean values can be set in your code/props much the same way any other value can be assigned to a variable or property.</p>
<pre><code>;true                   =&gt; true
;false                  =&gt; false
;true == true           =&gt; 1
;false == false         =&gt; 1
;true == false          =&gt; 0
;1 == true              =&gt; 1
;5 == true              =&gt; 0
;0 == false             =&gt; 1
;-1 == false            =&gt; 0
!true                   =&gt; 0
!false                  =&gt; 1
!false == true          =&gt; 1
!true == false          =&gt; 1
</code></pre>
<p>The true and false variables are set at task runtime (or your code) and can be overridden within verbs if needed. This will not carryover after the verb is finished executing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine Point: As mentioned earlier, there are constants like STR which resolved to the integer code 2. OBJ resolves to the integer code of 1. Thus if you were to execute code such as <code>typeof(#15840) == TRUE</code> you would get a truthy response, as typeof() would return <code>1</code> to denote the object's integer code. This is a side effect of <code>true</code> always equaling 1, for compatibility reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="getting-and-setting-the-values-of-properties"><a class="header" href="#getting-and-setting-the-values-of-properties">Getting and Setting the Values of Properties</a></h2>
<p>Usually, one can read the value of a property on an object with a simple expression:</p>
<pre><code>expression.name
</code></pre>
<p>Expression must return an object number; if not, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. If the object with that number does not exist, <code>E_INVIND</code> is raised. Otherwise, if the object does not have a property with that name, then <code>E_PROPNF</code> is raised. Otherwise, if the named property is not readable by the owner of the current verb, then <code>E_PERM</code> is raised. Finally, assuming that none of these terrible things happens, the value of the named property on the given object is returned.</p>
<p>I said "usually" in the paragraph above because that simple expression only works if the name of the property obeys the same rules as for the names of variables (i.e., consists entirely of letters, digits, and underscores, and doesn't begin with a digit). Property names are not restricted to this set, though. Also, it is sometimes useful to be able to figure out what property to read by some computation. For these more general uses, the following syntax is also allowed:</p>
<pre><code>expression-1.(expression-2)
</code></pre>
<p>As before, expression-1 must return an object number. Expression-2 must return a string, the name of the property to be read; <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised otherwise. Using this syntax, any property can be read, regardless of its name.</p>
<p>Note that, as with almost everything in MOO, case is not significant in the names of properties. Thus, the following expressions are all equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>foo.bar
foo.Bar
foo.("bAr")
</code></pre>
<p>The ToastCore database uses several properties on <code>#0</code>, the <em>system object</em>, for various special purposes. For example, the value of <code>#0.room</code> is the "generic room" object, <code>#0.exit</code> is the "generic exit" object, etc. This allows MOO programs to refer to these useful objects more easily (and more readably) than using their object numbers directly. To make this usage even easier and more readable, the expression</p>
<pre><code>$name
</code></pre>
<p>(where name obeys the rules for variable names) is an abbreviation for</p>
<pre><code>#0.name
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, for example, the value <code>$nothing</code> mentioned earlier is really <code>#-1</code>, the value of <code>#0.nothing</code>.</p>
<p>As with variables, one uses the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) to change the value of a property. For example, the expression</p>
<pre><code>14 + (#27.foo = 17)
</code></pre>
<p>changes the value of the <code>foo</code> property of the object numbered 27 to be 17 and then returns 31. Assignments to properties check that the owner of the current verb has write permission on the given property, raising <code>E_PERM</code> otherwise. Read permission is not required.</p>
<h2 id="calling-built-in-functions-and-other-verbs"><a class="header" href="#calling-built-in-functions-and-other-verbs">Calling Built-in Functions and Other Verbs</a></h2>
<p>MOO provides a large number of useful functions for performing a wide variety of operations; a complete list, giving their names, arguments, and semantics, appears in a separate section later. As an example to give you the idea, there is a function named <code>length</code> that returns the length of a given string or list.</p>
<p>The syntax of a call to a function is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>name(expr-1, expr-2, ..., expr-N)
</code></pre>
<p>where name is the name of one of the built-in functions. The expressions between the parentheses, called <em>arguments</em>, are each evaluated in turn and then given to the named function to use in its appropriate way. Most functions require that a specific number of arguments be given; otherwise, <code>E_ARGS</code> is raised. Most also require that certain of the arguments have certain specified types (e.g., the <code>length()</code> function requires a list or a string as its argument); <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised if any argument has the wrong type.</p>
<p>As with list construction, the splicing operator <code>@</code> can precede any argument expression. The value of such an expression must be a list; <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised otherwise. The elements of this list are passed as individual arguments, in place of the list as a whole.</p>
<p>Verbs can also call other verbs, usually using this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>expr-0:name(expr-1, expr-2, ..., expr-N)
</code></pre>
<p>Expr-0 must return an object number; <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised otherwise. If the object with that number does not exist, <code>E_INVIND</code> is raised. If this task is too deeply nested in verbs calling verbs calling verbs, then <code>E_MAXREC</code> is raised; the default limit is 50 levels, but this can be changed from within the database; see the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details. If neither the object nor any of its ancestors defines a verb matching the given name, <code>E_VERBNF</code> is raised. Otherwise, if none of these nasty things happens, the named verb on the given object is called; the various built-in variables have the following initial values in the called verb:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>this</code></td><td>an object, the value of expr-0</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>verb</code></td><td>a string, the name used in calling this verb</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>args</code></td><td>a list, the values of expr-1, expr-2, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>caller</code></td><td>an object, the value of <code>this</code> in the calling verb</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>player</code></td><td>an object, the same value as it had initially in the calling verb or, if the calling verb is running with wizard permissions, the same as the current value in the calling verb.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>All other built-in variables (<code>argstr</code>, <code>dobj</code>, etc.) are initialized with the same values they have in the calling verb.</p>
<p>As with the discussion of property references above, I said "usually" at the beginning of the previous paragraph because that syntax is only allowed when the name follows the rules for allowed variable names. Also as with property reference, there is a syntax allowing you to compute the name of the verb:</p>
<pre><code>expr-0:(expr-00)(expr-1, expr-2, ..., expr-N)
</code></pre>
<p>The expression expr-00 must return a string; <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised otherwise.</p>
<p>The splicing operator (<code>@</code>) can be used with verb-call arguments, too, just as with the arguments to built-in functions.</p>
<p>In many databases, a number of important verbs are defined on <code>#0</code>, the <em>system object</em>. As with the <code>$foo</code> notation for properties on <code>#0</code>, the server defines a special syntax for calling verbs on <code>#0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$name(expr-1, expr-2, ..., expr-N)
</code></pre>
<p>(where name obeys the rules for variable names) is an abbreviation for</p>
<pre><code>#0:name(expr-1, expr-2, ..., expr-N)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="verb-calls-on-primitive-types"><a class="header" href="#verb-calls-on-primitive-types">Verb Calls on Primitive Types</a></h2>
<p>The server supports verbs calls on primitive types (numbers, strings, etc.) so calls like <code>"foo bar":split()</code> can be implemented and work as expected (they were always syntactically correct in LambdaMOO but resulted in an E_TYPE error). Verbs are implemented on prototype object delegates ($int_proto, $float_proto, $str_proto, etc.). The server transparently invokes the correct verb on the appropriate prototype -- the primitive value is the value of `this'.</p>
<p>This also includes supporting calling verbs on an object prototype ($obj_proto). Counterintuitively, this will only work for types of OBJ that are invalid. This can come in useful for un-logged-in connections (i.e. creating a set of convenient utilities for dealing with negative connections in-MOO).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine Point: Utilizing verbs on primitives is a matter of style. Some people like it, some people don't. The author suggests you keep a utility object (like $string_utils) and simply forward verb calls from your primitive to this utility, which keeps backwards compatibility with how ToastCore and LambdaCore are generally built. By default in ToastCore, the primitives just wrap around their <code>type</code>_utils counterparts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="catching-errors-in-expressions"><a class="header" href="#catching-errors-in-expressions">Catching Errors in Expressions</a></h2>
<p>It is often useful to be able to <em>catch</em> an error that an expression raises, to keep the error from aborting the whole task, and to keep on running as if the expression had returned some other value normally. The following expression accomplishes this:</p>
<pre><code>` expr-1 ! codes =&gt; expr-2 '
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The open- and close-quotation marks in the previous line are really part of the syntax; you must actually type them as part of your MOO program for this kind of expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The codes part is either the keyword <code>ANY</code> or else a comma-separated list of expressions, just like an argument list. As in an argument list, the splicing operator (<code>@</code>) can be used here. The <code>=&gt; expr-2</code> part of the error-catching expression is optional.</p>
<p>First, the codes part is evaluated, yielding a list of error codes that should be caught if they're raised; if codes is <code>ANY</code>, then it is equivalent to the list of all possible MOO values.</p>
<p>Next, expr-1 is evaluated. If it evaluates normally, without raising an error, then its value becomes the value of the entire error-catching expression. If evaluating expr-1 results in an error being raised, then call that error E. If E is in the list resulting from evaluating codes, then E is considered <em>caught</em> by this error-catching expression. In such a case, if expr-2 was given, it is evaluated to get the outcome of the entire error-catching expression; if expr-2 was omitted, then E becomes the value of the entire expression. If E is <em>not</em> in the list resulting from codes, then this expression does not catch the error at all and it continues to be raised, possibly to be caught by some piece of code either surrounding this expression or higher up on the verb-call stack.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of this kind of expression:</p>
<pre><code>`x + 1 ! E_TYPE =&gt; 0'
</code></pre>
<p>Returns <code>x + 1</code> if <code>x</code> is an integer, returns <code>0</code> if <code>x</code> is not an integer, and raises <code>E_VARNF</code> if <code>x</code> doesn't have a value.</p>
<pre><code>`x.y ! E_PROPNF, E_PERM =&gt; 17'
</code></pre>
<p>Returns <code>x.y</code> if that doesn't cause an error, <code>17</code> if <code>x</code> doesn't have a <code>y</code> property or that property isn't readable, and raises some other kind of error (like <code>E_INVIND</code>) if <code>x.y</code> does.</p>
<pre><code>`1 / 0 ! ANY'
</code></pre>
<p>Returns <code>E_DIV</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: It's important to mention how powerful this compact syntax for writing error catching code can be. When used properly you can write very complex and elegant code. For example imagine that you have a set of objects from different parents, some of which define a specific verb, and some of which do not. If for instance, your code wants to perform some function <em>if</em> the verb exists, you can write `obj:verbname() ! E_VERBNF' to allow the MOO to attempt to execute that verb and then if it fails, catch the error and continue operations normally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="parentheses-and-operator-precedence"><a class="header" href="#parentheses-and-operator-precedence">Parentheses and Operator Precedence</a></h2>
<p>As shown in a few examples above, MOO allows you to use parentheses to make it clear how you intend for complex expressions to be grouped. For example, the expression</p>
<pre><code>3 * (4 + 5)
</code></pre>
<p>performs the addition of 4 and 5 before multiplying the result by 3.</p>
<p>If you leave out the parentheses, MOO will figure out how to group the expression according to certain rules. The first of these is that some operators have higher <em>precedence</em> than others; operators with higher precedence will more tightly bind to their operands than those with lower precedence. For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition; thus, if the parentheses had been left out of the expression in the previous paragraph, MOO would have grouped it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(3 * 4) + 5
</code></pre>
<p>The table below gives the relative precedence of all of the MOO operators; operators on higher lines in the table have higher precedence and those on the same line have identical precedence:</p>
<pre><code>!       - (without a left operand)
^
*       /       %
+       -
==      !=      &lt;       &lt;=      &gt;       &gt;=      in
&amp;&amp;      ||
... ? ... | ... (the conditional expression)
=
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, the horrendous expression</p>
<pre><code>x = a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c &gt; d + e * f ? w in y | - q - r
</code></pre>
<p>would be grouped as follows:</p>
<pre><code>x = (((a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; (c &gt; (d + (e * f)))) ? (w in y) | ((- q) - r))
</code></pre>
<p>It is best to keep expressions simpler than this and to use parentheses liberally to make your meaning clear to other humans.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="moo-language-statements"><a class="header" href="#moo-language-statements">MOO Language Statements</a></h1>
<p>Statements are MOO constructs that, in contrast to expressions, perform some useful, non-value-producing operation. For example, there are several kinds of statements, called <em>looping constructs</em>, that repeatedly perform some set of operations. Fortunately, there are many fewer kinds of statements in MOO than there are kinds of expressions.</p>
<h2 id="errors-while-executing-statements"><a class="header" href="#errors-while-executing-statements">Errors While Executing Statements</a></h2>
<p>Statements do not return values, but some kinds of statements can, under certain circumstances described below, generate errors. If such an error is generated in a verb whose <code>d</code> (debug) bit is not set, then the error is ignored and the statement that generated it is simply skipped; execution proceeds with the next statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This error-ignoring behavior is very error prone, since it affects <em>all</em> errors, including ones the programmer may not have anticipated. The <code>d</code> bit exists only for historical reasons; it was once the only way for MOO programmers to catch and handle errors. The error-catching expression and the <code>try</code> -<code>except</code> statement are far better ways of accomplishing the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the <code>d</code> bit is set, as it usually is, then the error is <em>raised</em> and can be caught and handled either by code surrounding the expression in question or by verbs higher up on the chain of calls leading to the current verb. If the error is not caught, then the server aborts the entire task and, by default, prints a message to the current player. See the descriptions of the error-catching expression and the <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement for the details of how errors can be caught, and the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details on the handling of uncaught errors.</p>
<h2 id="simple-statements"><a class="header" href="#simple-statements">Simple Statements</a></h2>
<p>The simplest kind of statement is the <em>null</em> statement, consisting of just a semicolon:</p>
<pre><code>;
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't do anything at all, but it does it very quickly.</p>
<p>The next simplest statement is also one of the most common, the expression statement, consisting of any expression followed by a semicolon:</p>
<pre><code>expression;
</code></pre>
<p>The given expression is evaluated and the resulting value is ignored. Commonly-used kinds of expressions for such statements include assignments and verb calls. Of course, there's no use for such a statement unless the evaluation of expression has some side-effect, such as changing the value of some variable or property, printing some text on someone's screen, etc.</p>
<pre><code>#42.weight = 40;
#42.weight;
2 + 5;
obj:verbname();
1 &gt; 2;
2 &lt; 1;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="statements-for-testing-conditions"><a class="header" href="#statements-for-testing-conditions">Statements for Testing Conditions</a></h2>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement allows you to decide whether or not to perform some statements based on the value of an arbitrary expression:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression)
  statements
endif
</code></pre>
<p>Expression is evaluated and, if it returns a true value, the statements are executed in order; otherwise, nothing more is done.</p>
<p>One frequently wants to perform one set of statements if some condition is true and some other set of statements otherwise. The optional <code>else</code> phrase in an <code>if</code> statement allows you to do this:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression)
  statements-1
else
  statements-2
endif
</code></pre>
<p>This statement is executed just like the previous one, except that statements-1 are executed if expression returns a true value and statements-2 are executed otherwise.</p>
<p>Sometimes, one needs to test several conditions in a kind of nested fashion:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression-1)
  statements-1
else
  if (expression-2)
    statements-2
  else
    if (expression-3)
      statements-3
    else
      statements-4
    endif
  endif
endif
</code></pre>
<p>Such code can easily become tedious to write and difficult to read. MOO provides a somewhat simpler notation for such cases:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression-1)
  statements-1
elseif (expression-2)
  statements-2
elseif (expression-3)
  statements-3
else
  statements-4
endif
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>elseif</code> is written as a single word, without any spaces. This simpler version has the very same meaning as the original: evaluate expression-i for i equal to 1, 2, and 3, in turn, until one of them returns a true value; then execute the statements-i associated with that expression. If none of the expression-i return a true value, then execute statements-4.</p>
<p>Any number of <code>elseif</code> phrases can appear, each having this form:</p>
<pre><code>elseif (expression)
    statements
</code></pre>
<p>The complete syntax of the <code>if</code> statement, therefore, is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>if (expression)
  statements
zero-or-more-elseif-phrases
an-optional-else-phrase
endif
</code></pre>
<h2 id="statements-for-looping"><a class="header" href="#statements-for-looping">Statements for Looping</a></h2>
<p>MOO provides three different kinds of looping statements, allowing you to have a set of statements executed (1) once for each element of a given sequence (list, map or string); (2) once for each integer or object number in a given range; and (3) over and over until a given condition stops being true.</p>
<p>To perform some statements once for each element of a given sequence, use this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>for value, key-or-index in (expression)
  statements
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The expression is evaluated and should return a list, map or string; if it does not, E_TYPE is raised. The statements are then executed once for each element of that sequence in turn; each time, the given value is assigned the value of the element in question, and key-or-index is assigned the index of value in the list or string, or its key if the sequence is a map. key-or-index is optional. For example, consider the following statements:</p>
<pre><code>odds = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
evens = {};
for n in (odds)
  evens = {@evens, n + 1};
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the variable <code>evens</code> after executing these statements is the list</p>
<p><code>{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}</code></p>
<p>If the example were modified:</p>
<pre><code>odds = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
pairs = [];
for n, i in (odds)
  pairs[i] = n + 1;
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the variable <code>pairs</code> after executing these statements is the map</p>
<p><code>[1 -&gt; 2, 2 -&gt; 4, 3 -&gt; 6, 4 -&gt; 8, 5 -&gt; 10]</code></p>
<p>To perform a set of statements once for each integer or object number in a given range, use this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>for variable in [expression-1..expression-2]
  statements
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The two expressions are evaluated in turn and should either both return integers or both return object numbers; E_TYPE is raised otherwise. The statements are then executed once for each integer (or object number, as appropriate) greater than or equal to the value of expression-1 and less than or equal to the result of expression-2, in increasing order. Each time, the given variable is assigned the integer or object number in question. For example, consider the following statements:</p>
<pre><code>evens = {};
for n in [1..5]
  evens = {@evens, 2 * n};
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The value of the variable <code>evens</code> after executing these statements is just as in the previous example: the list</p>
<p><code>{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}</code></p>
<p>The following loop over object numbers prints out the number and name of every valid object in the database:</p>

  if (valid(o))
    notify(player, tostr(o, ": ", o.name));

</code></pre>
<p>The final kind of loop in MOO executes a set of statements repeatedly as long as a given condition remains true:</p>
<pre><code>while (expression)
  statements
endwhile
</code></pre>
<p>The expression is evaluated and, if it returns a true value, the statements are executed; then, execution of the <code>while</code> statement begins all over again with the evaluation of the expression. That is, execution alternates between evaluating the expression and executing the statements until the expression returns a false value. The following example code has precisely the same effect as the loop just shown above:</p>
<pre><code>evens = {};
n = 1;
while (n &lt;= 5)
  evens = {@evens, 2 * n};
  n = n + 1;
endwhile
</code></pre>
<p>Fine point: It is also possible to give a <em>name</em> to a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code>while name (expression)
  statements
endwhile
</code></pre>
<p>which has precisely the same effect as</p>
<pre><code>while (name = expression)
  statements
endwhile
</code></pre>
<p>This naming facility is only really useful in conjunction with the <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements, described in the next section.</p>
<p>With each kind of loop, it is possible that the statements in the body of the loop will never be executed at all. For iteration over lists, this happens when the list returned by the expression is empty. For iteration on integers, it happens when expression-1 returns a larger integer than expression-2. Finally, for the <code>while</code> loop, it happens if the expression returns a false value the very first time it is evaluated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: With <code>while</code> loops it is especially important to make sure you do not create an infinite loop. That is, a loop that will never terminate because it's expression will never become false. Be especially careful if you suspend(), yin(), or $command_utils:suspend_if_needed() within a loop, as the task may never run out of ticks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="terminating-one-or-all-iterations-of-a-loop"><a class="header" href="#terminating-one-or-all-iterations-of-a-loop">Terminating One or All Iterations of a Loop</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, it is useful to exit a loop before it finishes all of its iterations. For example, if the loop is used to search for a particular kind of element of a list, then it might make sense to stop looping as soon as the right kind of element is found, even if there are more elements yet to see. The <code>break</code> statement is used for this purpose; it has the form</p>
<pre><code>break;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>break name;
</code></pre>
<p>Each <code>break</code> statement indicates a specific surrounding loop; if name is not given, the statement refers to the innermost one. If it is given, name must be the name appearing right after the <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> keyword of the desired enclosing loop. When the <code>break</code> statement is executed, the indicated loop is immediately terminated and executing continues just as if the loop had completed its iterations normally.</p>
<p>MOO also allows you to terminate just the current iteration of a loop, making it immediately go on to the next one, if any. The <code>continue</code> statement does this; it has precisely the same forms as the <code>break</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>continue;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>continue name;
</code></pre>
<p>An example that sums up a list of integers, excluding any integer equal to four:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
sum = 0;
for element in (my_list)
    if (element == 4)
        continue;
    endif
    sum = sum + element;
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>An example that breaks out of hte loop when a specific object in a list is found</p>
<pre><code>my_list = {#13633, #98, #15840, #18657, #22664};
i = 0;
found = 0;
for obj in (my_list)
    i = i + 1;
    if (obj == #18657)
        found = 1;
        break;
    endif
endfor
if (found)
    notify(player, tostr("found #18657 at ", i, " index"));
else
    notify(player, "couldn't find #18657 in the list!");
endif
</code></pre>
<h2 id="returning-a-value-from-a-verb"><a class="header" href="#returning-a-value-from-a-verb">Returning a Value from a Verb</a></h2>
<p>The MOO program in a verb is just a sequence of statements. Normally, when the verb is called, those statements are simply executed in order and then the integer 0 is returned as the value of the verb-call expression. Using the <code>return</code> statement, one can change this behavior. The <code>return</code> statement has one of the following two forms:</p>
<pre><code>return;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>return expression;
</code></pre>
<p>When it is executed, execution of the current verb is terminated immediately after evaluating the given expression, if any. The verb-call expression that started the execution of this verb then returns either the value of expression or the integer 0, if no expression was provided.</p>
<p>We could modify the example given above. Imagine a verb called has_object which takes an object (that we want to find) as it's first argument and a list of objects (to search) as it's second argument:</p>
<pre><code>{seek_obj, list_of_objects} = args;
for obj in (list_of_objects)
    if (obj == seek_obj)
        return 1;
    endif
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>The verb above could be called with <code>obj_with_verb:has_object(#18657, {#1, #3, #4, #3000})</code> and it would return <code>false</code> (0) if the object was not found in the list. It would return <code>true</code> (1) if the object was found in the list.</p>
<p>Of course we could write this much more simply (and get the index of the object in the list at the same time):</p>
<pre><code>{seek_obj, list_of_objects} = args;
return seek_obj in list_of_objects;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="handling-errors-in-statements"><a class="header" href="#handling-errors-in-statements">Handling Errors in Statements</a></h2>
<p>A traceback is raised when there is an error in the execution of code (this differs from a compilation error you might see when programming a verb).</p>
<p>Examples to cause tracebacks:</p>
<pre><code>;notify(5)

#-1:Input to EVAL (this == #-1), line 3:  Incorrect number of arguments (expected 2-4; got 1)
... called from built-in function eval()
... called from #58:eval_cmd_string, line 19
... called from #58:eval*-d, line 13
(End of traceback)
</code></pre>
<p>And another example:</p>
<pre><code>;notify(me, 5)

#-1:Input to EVAL (this == #-1), line 3:  Type mismatch (args[1] of notify() expected object; got integer)
... called from built-in function eval()
... called from #58:eval_cmd_string, line 19
... called from #58:eval*-d, line 13
(End of traceback)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in the above examples, ToastStunt will tell you the line number of the error, as well as some additional information about the error, including the expected number of arguments and the type. This will also work when you are catching errors in a try/except statement (detailed below).</p>
<p>Additional, you will also be shown {object, verb / property name} when you try to access a verb or property that was not found.</p>
<p>Normally, whenever a piece of MOO code raises an error, the entire task is aborted and a message printed to the user. Often, such errors can be anticipated in advance by the programmer and code written to deal with them in a more graceful manner. The <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement allows you to do this; the syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>try
  statements-0
except variable-1 (codes-1)
  statements-1
except variable-2 (codes-2)
  statements-2
...
endtry
</code></pre>
<p>where the variables may be omitted and each codes part is either the keyword <code>ANY</code> or else a comma-separated list of expressions, just like an argument list. As in an argument list, the splicing operator (<code>@</code>) can be used here. There can be anywhere from 1 to 255 <code>except</code> clauses.</p>
<p>First, each codes part is evaluated, yielding a list of error codes that should be caught if they're raised; if a codes is <code>ANY</code>, then it is equivalent to the list of all possible MOO values.</p>
<p>Next, statements-0 is executed; if it doesn't raise an error, then that's all that happens for the entire <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement. Otherwise, let E be the error it raises. From top to bottom, E is searched for in the lists resulting from the various codes parts; if it isn't found in any of them, then it continues to be raised, possibly to be caught by some piece of code either surrounding this <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement or higher up on the verb-call stack.</p>
<p>If E is found first in codes-i, then variable-i (if provided) is assigned a value containing information about the error being raised and statements-i is executed. The value assigned to variable-i is a list of four elements:</p>
<pre><code>{code, message, value, traceback}
</code></pre>
<p>where code is E, the error being raised, message and value are as provided by the code that raised the error, and traceback is a list like that returned by the <code>callers()</code> function, including line numbers. The traceback list contains entries for every verb from the one that raised the error through the one containing this <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise mentioned, all of the built-in errors raised by expressions, statements, and functions provide <code>tostr(code)</code> as message and zero as value.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the use of this kind of statement:</p>
<pre><code>try
  result = object:(command)(@arguments);
  player:tell("=&gt; ", toliteral(result));
except v (ANY)
  tb = v[4];
  if (length(tb) == 1)
    player:tell("** Illegal command: ", v[2]);
  else
    top = tb[1];
    tb[1..1] = {};
    player:tell(top[1], ":", top[2], ", line ", top[6], ":", v[2]);
    for fr in (tb)
      player:tell("... called from ", fr[1], ":", fr[2], ", line ", fr[6]);
    endfor
    player:tell("(End of traceback)");
  endif
endtry
</code></pre>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-after-errors"><a class="header" href="#cleaning-up-after-errors">Cleaning Up After Errors</a></h2>
<p>Whenever an error is raised, it is usually the case that at least some MOO code gets skipped over and never executed. Sometimes, it's important that a piece of code <em>always</em> be executed, whether or not an error is raised. Use the <code>try</code>-<code>finally</code> statement for these cases; it has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>try
  statements-1
finally
  statements-2
endtry
</code></pre>
<p>First, statements-1 is executed; if it completes without raising an error, returning from this verb, or terminating the current iteration of a surrounding loop (we call these possibilities <em>transferring control</em>), then statements-2 is executed and that's all that happens for the entire <code>try</code>-<code>finally</code> statement.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the process of transferring control is interrupted and statements-2 is executed. If statements-2 itself completes without transferring control, then the interrupted control transfer is resumed just where it left off. If statements-2 does transfer control, then the interrupted transfer is simply forgotten in favor of the new one.</p>
<p>In short, this statement ensures that statements-2 is executed after control leaves statements-1 for whatever reason; it can thus be used to make sure that some piece of cleanup code is run even if statements-1 doesn't simply run normally to completion.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>try
  start = time();
  object:(command)(@arguments);
finally
  end = time();
  this:charge_user_for_seconds(player, end - start);
endtry
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: If a task runs out of ticks, it's possible for your finally code to not run.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="executing-statements-at-a-later-time"><a class="header" href="#executing-statements-at-a-later-time">Executing Statements at a Later Time</a></h2>
<p>It is sometimes useful to have some sequence of statements execute at a later time, without human intervention. For example, one might implement an object that, when thrown into the air, eventually falls back to the ground; the <code>throw</code> verb on that object should arrange to print a message about the object landing on the ground, but the message shouldn't be printed until some number of seconds have passed.</p>
<p>The <code>fork</code> statement is intended for just such situations and has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>fork (expression)
  statements
endfork
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>fork</code> statement first executes the expression, which must return an integer or float; call that value n. It then creates a new MOO <em>task</em> that will, after at least n seconds (or sub seconds in the case of a float like 0.1), execute the statements. When the new task begins, all variables will have the values they had at the time the <code>fork</code> statement was executed. The task executing the <code>fork</code> statement immediately continues execution. The concept of tasks is discussed in detail in the next section.</p>
<p>By default, there is no limit to the number of tasks any player may fork, but such a limit can be imposed from within the database. See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one would like to be able to kill a forked task before it even starts; for example, some player might have caught the object that was thrown into the air, so no message should be printed about it hitting the ground. If a variable name is given after the <code>fork</code> keyword, like this:</p>
<pre><code>fork name (expression)
  statements
endfork
</code></pre>
<p>then that variable is assigned the <em>task ID</em> of the newly-created task. The value of this variable is visible both to the task executing the fork statement and to the statements in the newly-created task. This ID can be passed to the <code>kill_task()</code> function to keep the task from running and will be the value of <code>task_id()</code> once the task begins execution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This feature has other uses as well. The MOO is single threaded (though ToastStunt supports some built-ins executing on other threads), which means that complex logic (verbs that call verbs that call verbs ...) can cause the MOO to <em>lag</em>. For instance, let's say when your user tosses their ball up, you want to calculate a complex trajectory involve the ball and other objects in the room. These calculations are costly and done in another verb, they take time to be performed. However, you want some actions to happen both before the calculations (everyone in the room seeing the ball is thrown into the air) and after the ball has left the players hands (the player reaches into their pocket and pulls out a new ball). If there is no <code>fork()</code> then the calculations need to complete before the verb can continue execution, which means the player won't pull out a fresh ball until after the calculations are complete. A <code>fork()</code> allows the player to throw the ball, the MOO to <code>fork()</code> the task, which allows execution of the verb to continue right away and the user to pull out a new ball, without experiencing the delay that the calculations being returned (without a <code>fork()</code>) would have incurred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of this:</p>
<pre><code>{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
ball:calculate_trajectory();
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, <code>player:tell("You get out another ball!");</code> will not be executed until after <code>ball:calculate_trajectory();</code> is completed.</p>
<pre><code>{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
fork (1)
    ball:calculate_trajectory();
endfor
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
</code></pre>
<p>In this forked example, the ball will be thrown, the task forked for 1 second later and the the final line telling the player they got out another ball will be followed up right after, without having to wait for the trajectory verb to finish running.</p>
<p>This type of fork cannot be used if the trajectory is required by the code that runs after it. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
direction = ball:calculate_trajectory();
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
player:tell("Your ball arcs to the " + direction);
</code></pre>
<p>If the above task was forked as it is below:</p>
<pre><code>{ball} = args;
player:tell("You throw the ball!");
fork (1)
    direction = ball:calculate_trajectory();
endfork
player:tell("You get out another ball!");
player:tell("Your ball arcs to the " + direction);
</code></pre>
<p>The verb would raise <code>E_VARNF</code> due to direction not being defined.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="moo-tasks"><a class="header" href="#moo-tasks">MOO Tasks</a></h1>
<p>A <em>task</em> is an execution of a MOO program. There are five kinds of tasks in ToastStunt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time a player types a command, a task is created to execute that command; we call these <em>command tasks</em>.</li>
<li>Whenever a player connects or disconnects from the MOO, the server starts a task to do whatever processing is necessary, such as printing out <code>Munchkin has connected</code> to all of the players in the same room; these are called <em>server tasks</em>.</li>
<li>The <code>fork</code> statement in the programming language creates a task whose execution is delayed for at least some given number of seconds; these are <em>forked tasks</em>. Sub-second forking is possible (eg. 0.1)</li>
<li>The <code>suspend()</code> function suspends the execution of the current task. A snapshot is taken of whole state of the execution, and the execution will be resumed later. These are called <em>suspended tasks</em>. Sub-second suspending is possible.</li>
<li>The <code>read()</code> function also suspends the execution of the current task, in this case waiting for the player to type a line of input. When the line is received, the task resumes with the <code>read()</code> function returning the input line as result. These are called <em>reading tasks</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last three kinds of tasks above are collectively known as <em>queued tasks</em> or <em>background tasks</em>, since they may not run immediately.</p>
<p>To prevent a maliciously- or incorrectly-written MOO program from running forever and monopolizing the server, limits are placed on the running time of every task. One limit is that no task is allowed to run longer than a certain number of seconds; command and server tasks get five seconds each while other tasks get only three seconds. This limit is, in practice, rarely reached. The reason is that there is also a limit on the number of operations a task may execute.</p>
<p>The server counts down <em>ticks</em> as any task executes. Roughly speaking, it counts one tick for every expression evaluation (other than variables and literals), one for every <code>if</code>, <code>fork</code> or <code>return</code> statement, and one for every iteration of a loop. If the count gets all the way down to zero, the task is immediately and unceremoniously aborted. By default, command and server tasks begin with a store of 60,000 ticks; this is enough for almost all normal uses. Forked, suspended, and reading tasks are allotted 30,000 ticks each.</p>
<p>These limits on seconds and ticks may be changed from within the database, as can the behavior of the server after it aborts a task for running out; see the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<p>Because queued tasks may exist for long periods of time before they begin execution, there are functions to list the ones that you own and to kill them before they execute. These functions, among others, are discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>Some server functions, when given large or complicated amounts of data, may take a significant amount of time to complete their work. When this happens, the MOO can't process any other player input or background tasks and users will experience lag. To help diagnose the causes of lag, ToastStunt provides the <code>DEFAULT_LAG_THRESHOLD</code> option in options.h (which can be overridden in the database. See the Server Assumptions About the Database section). When a running task exceeds this number of seconds, the server will make a note in the server log and call the verb <code>#0:handle_lagging_task()</code> with the arguments: <code>{callers, execution time}</code>. Callers will be a <code>callers()</code>-style list of every verb call leading up to the lagging verb, and execution time will be the total time it took the verb to finish executing. This can help you gauge exactly what verb is causing the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Depending on your system configuration, FG_SECONDS and BG_SECONDS may not necessarily correspond to actual seconds in real time. They often measure CPU time. This is why your verbs can lag for several seconds in real life and still not raise an 'out of seconds' error."</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="built-in-functions"><a class="header" href="#built-in-functions">Built-in Functions</a></h1>
<p>There are a large number of built-in functions available for use by MOO programmers. Each one is discussed in detail in this section. The presentation is broken up into subsections by grouping together functions with similar or related uses.</p>
<p>For most functions, the expected types of the arguments are given; if the actual arguments are not of these types, <code>E_TYPE</code> is raised. Some arguments can be of any type at all; in such cases, no type specification is given for the argument. Also, for most functions, the type of the result of the function is given. Some functions do not return a useful result; in such cases, the specification <code>none</code> is used. A few functions can potentially return any type of value at all; in such cases, the specification <code>value</code> is used.</p>
<p>Most functions take a certain fixed number of required arguments and, in some cases, one or two optional arguments. If a function is called with too many or too few arguments, <code>E_ARGS</code> is raised.</p>
<p>Functions are always called by the program for some verb; that program is running with the permissions of some player, usually the owner of the verb in question (it is not always the owner, though; wizards can use <code>set_task_perms()</code> to change the permissions <em>on the fly</em>). In the function descriptions below, we refer to the player whose permissions are being used as the <em>programmer</em>.</p>
<p>Many built-in functions are described below as raising <code>E_PERM</code> unless the programmer meets certain specified criteria. It is possible to restrict use of any function, however, so that only wizards can use it; see the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="object-oriented-programming"><a class="header" href="#object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming</a></h1>
<p>One of the most important facilities in an object-oriented programming language is ability for a child object to make use of a parent's implementation of some operation, even when the child provides its own definition for that operation. The <code>pass()</code> function provides this facility in MOO.</p>
<h3 id="function-pass"><a class="header" href="#function-pass">Function: <code>pass</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>value pass(arg, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as defined on the parent of the object that defines the current verb.</p>
<p>Often, it is useful for a child object to define a verb that <em>augments</em> the behavior of a verb on its parent object. For example, in the ToastCore database, the root object (which is an ancestor of every other object) defines a verb called <code>description</code> that simply returns the value of <code>this.description</code>; this verb is used by the implementation of the <code>look</code> command. In many cases, a programmer would like the
description of some object to include some non-constant part; for example, a sentence about whether or not the object was 'awake' or 'sleeping'. This sentence should be added onto the end of the normal description. The programmer would like to have a means of calling the normal <code>description</code> verb and then appending the sentence onto the end of that description. The function <code>pass()</code> is for exactly such situations.</p>
<p><code>pass</code> calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as defined on the parent of the object that defines the current verb. The arguments given to <code>pass</code> are the ones given to the called verb and the returned value of the called verb is returned from the call to <code>pass</code>. The initial value of <code>this</code> in the called verb is the same as in the calling verb.</p>
<p>Thus, in the example above, the child-object's <code>description</code> verb might have the following implementation:</p>
<pre><code>return pass() + "  It is " + (this.awake ? "awake." | "sleeping.");
</code></pre>
<p>That is, it calls its parent's <code>description</code> verb and then appends to the result a sentence whose content is computed based on the value of a property on the object.</p>
<p>In almost all cases, you will want to call <code>pass()</code> with the same arguments as were given to the current verb. This is easy to write in MOO; just call <code>pass(@args)</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="manipulating-moo-values"><a class="header" href="#manipulating-moo-values">Manipulating MOO Values</a></h1>
<p>There are several functions for performing primitive operations on MOO values, and they can be cleanly split into two kinds: those that do various very general operations that apply to all types of values, and those that are specific to one particular type. There are so many operations concerned with objects that we do not list them in this section but rather give them their own section following this one.</p>
<h2 id="general-operations-applicable-to-all-values"><a class="header" href="#general-operations-applicable-to-all-values">General Operations Applicable to All Values</a></h2>
<h3 id="function-typeof"><a class="header" href="#function-typeof">Function: <code>typeof</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>int typeof(value)
</code></pre>
<p>Takes any MOO value and returns an integer representing the type of value.</p>
<p>The result is the same as the initial value of one of these built-in variables: <code>INT</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>STR</code>, <code>LIST</code>, <code>OBJ</code>, or <code>ERR</code>, <code>BOOL</code>, <code>MAP</code>, <code>WAIF</code>, <code>ANON</code>. Thus, one usually writes code like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (typeof(x) == LIST) ...
</code></pre>
<p>and not like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (typeof(x) == 3) ...
</code></pre>
<p>because the former is much more readable than the latter.</p>
<h3 id="function-tostr"><a class="header" href="#function-tostr">Function: <code>tostr</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>str tostr(value, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>Converts all of the given MOO values into strings and returns the concatenation of the results.</p>
<pre><code>tostr(17)                  =&gt;   "17"
tostr(1.0/3.0)             =&gt;   "0.333333333333333"
tostr(#17)                 =&gt;   "#17"
tostr("foo")               =&gt;   "foo"
tostr({1, 2})              =&gt;   "{list}"
tostr([1 -&gt; 2]             =&gt;   "[map]"
tostr(E_PERM)              =&gt;   "Permission denied"
tostr("3 + 4 = ", 3 + 4)   =&gt;   "3 + 4 = 7"
</code></pre>
<p>Warning <code>tostr()</code> does not do a good job of converting lists and maps into strings; all lists, including the empty list, are converted into the string <code>"{list}"</code> and all maps are converted into the string <code>"[map]"</code>. The function <code>toliteral()</code>, below, is better for this purpose.</p>
<h3 id="function-toliteral"><a class="header" href="#function-toliteral">Function: <code>toliteral</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>str toliteral(value)

<p>Converts the given MOO value into an integer and returns that integer.</p>
<p>Floating-point numbers are rounded toward zero, truncating their fractional parts. Object numbers are converted into the equivalent integers. Strings are parsed as the decimal encoding of a real number which is then converted to an integer. Errors are converted into integers obeying the same ordering (with respect to <code>&lt;=</code> as the errors themselves. <code>toint()</code> raises <code>E_TYPE</code> if value is a list. If value is a string but the string does not contain a syntactically-correct number, then <code>toint()</code> returns 0.</p>

<p>Integers and object numbers are converted into the corresponding integral floating-point numbers. Strings are parsed as the decimal encoding of a real number which is then represented as closely as possible as a floating-point number. Errors are first converted to integers as in <code>toint()</code> and then converted as integers are. <code>tofloat()</code> raises <code>E_TYPE</code> if value is a list. If value is a string but the string does not contain a syntactically-correct number, then <code>tofloat()</code> returns 0.</p>

<pre><code>str generate_json(value [, str mode])
</code></pre>
<p>Returns the JSON representation of the MOO value.</p>
<p>MOO supports a richer set of values than JSON allows. The optional mode specifies how this function handles the conversion of MOO values into their JSON representation.</p>
<p>The common subset mode, specified by the literal mode string "common-subset", is the default conversion mode. In this mode, only the common subset of types (strings and numbers) are translated with fidelity between MOO types and JSON types. All other types are treated as alternative representations of the string type. This mode is useful for integration with non-MOO applications.</p>
<p>The embedded types mode, specified by the literal mode string "embedded-types", adds type information. Specifically, values other than strings and numbers, which carry implicit type information, are converted into strings with type information appended. The converted string consists of the string representation of the value (as if tostr() were applied) followed by the pipe (|) character and the type. This mode is useful for serializing/deserializing objects and collections of MOO values.</p>

<p>ToastStunt has two methods of operating on regular expressions. The classic style (outdated, more difficult to use, detailed in the next section) and the preferred Perl Compatible Regular Expression library. It is beyond the scope of this document to teach regular expressions, but an internet search should provide all the information you need to get started on what will surely become a lifelong journey of either love or frustration.</p>
<p>ToastCore offers two primary methods of interacting with regular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="function-pcre_match"><a class="header" href="#function-pcre_match">Function: <code>pcre_match</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>LIST pcre_match(STR subject, STR pattern [, ?case matters=0] [, ?repeat until no matches=1])
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>pcre_match()</code> searches <code>subject</code> for <code>pattern</code> using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library.</p>
<p>The return value is a list of maps containing each match. Each returned map will have a key which corresponds to either a named capture group or the number of the capture group being matched. The full match is always found in the key "0". The value of each key will be another map containing the keys 'match' and 'position'. Match corresponds to the text that was matched and position will return the indices of the substring within <code>subject</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>repeat until no matches</code> is 1, the expression will continue to be evaluated until no further matches can be found or it exhausts the iteration limit. This defaults to 1.</p>
<p>Additionally, wizards can control how many iterations of the loop are possible by adding a property to $server_options. $server_options.pcre_match_max_iterations is the maximum number of loops allowed before giving up and allowing other tasks to proceed. CAUTION: It's recommended to keep this value fairly low. The default value is 1000. The minimum value is 100.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Extract dates from a string:</p>
<pre><code>pcre_match("09/12/1999 other random text 01/21/1952", "([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{4})")

=&gt; {["0" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "09/12/1999", "position" -&gt; {1, 10}], "1" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "09", "position" -&gt; {1, 2}], "2" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "12", "position" -&gt; {4, 5}], "3" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "1999", "position" -&gt; {7, 10}]], ["0" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "01/21/1952", "position" -&gt; {30, 39}], "1" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "01", "position" -&gt; {30, 31}], "2" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "21", "position" -&gt; {33, 34}], "3" -&gt; ["match" -&gt; "1952", "position" -&gt; {36, 39}]]}
</code></pre>
<p>Explode a string (albeit a contrived example):</p>
<pre><code>;;ret = {}; for x in (pcre_match("This is a string of words, with punctuation, that should be exploded. By space. --zippy--", "[a-zA-Z]+", 0, 1)) ret = {@ret, x["0"]["match"]}; endfor return ret;

=&gt; {"This", "is", "a", "string", "of", "words", "with", "punctuation", "that", "should", "be", "exploded", "By", "space", "zippy"}

<h3 id="function-pcre_replace"><a class="header" href="#function-pcre_replace">Function: <code>pcre_replace</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>STR pcre_replace(STR `subject`, STR `pattern`)
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>pcre_replace()</code> replaces <code>subject</code> with replacements found in <code>pattern</code> using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library.</p>
<p>The pattern string has a specific format that must be followed, which should be familiar if you have used the likes of Vim, Perl, or sed. The string is composed of four elements, each separated by a delimiter (typically a slash (/) or an exclamation mark (!)), that tell PCRE how to parse your replacement. We'll break the string down and mention relevant options below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type of search to perform. In MOO, only 's' is valid. This parameter is kept for the sake of consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text you want to search for a replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The regular expression you want to use for your replacement text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global. This will replace all occurrences in your string rather than stopping at the first.</li>
<li>Case-insensitive. Uppercase, lowercase, it doesn't matter. All will be replaced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Replace one word with another:</p>
<pre><code>pcre_replace("I like banana pie. Do you like banana pie?", "s/banana/apple/g")

=&gt; "I like apple pie. Do you like apple pie?"
</code></pre>
<p>If you find yourself wanting to replace a string that contains slashes, it can be useful to change your delimiter to an exclamation mark:</p>
<pre><code>pcre_replace("Unix, wow! /bin/bash is a thing.", "s!/bin/bash!/bin/fish!g")

=&gt; "Unix, wow! /bin/fish is a thing."
</code></pre>
<h2 id="legacy-moo-regular-expressions"><a class="header" href="#legacy-moo-regular-expressions">Legacy MOO Regular Expressions</a></h2>
<p><em>Regular expression</em> matching allows you to test whether a string fits into a specific syntactic shape. You can also search a string for a substring that fits a pattern.</p>
<p>A regular expression describes a set of strings. The simplest case is one that describes a particular string; for example, the string <code>foo</code> when regarded as a regular expression matches <code>foo</code> and nothing else. Nontrivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that they can match more than one string. For example, the regular expression <code>foo%|bar</code> matches either the string <code>foo</code> or the string <code>bar</code>; the regular expression <code>c[ad]*r</code> matches any of the strings <code>cr</code>, <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>, <code>caar</code>, <code>cadddar</code> and all other such strings with any number of <code>a</code>'s and <code>d</code>'s.</p>
<p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special constructs and the rest are <em>ordinary</em>. An ordinary character is a simple regular expression that matches that character and nothing else. The special characters are <code>$</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code> and <code>%</code>. Any other character appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a <code>%</code> precedes it.</p>
<p>For example, <code>f</code> is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and therefore <code>f</code> is a regular expression that matches the string <code>f</code> and no other string. (It does <em>not</em>, for example, match the string <code>ff</code>.) Likewise, <code>o</code> is a regular expression that matches only <code>o</code>.</p>
<p>Any two regular expressions a and b can be concatenated. The result is a regular expression which matches a string if a matches some amount of the beginning of that string and b matches the rest of the string.</p>
<p>As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions <code>f</code> and <code>o</code> to get the regular expression <code>fo</code>, which matches only the string <code>fo</code>. Still trivial.</p>
<p>The following are the characters and character sequences that have special meaning within regular expressions. Any character not mentioned here is not special; it stands for exactly itself for the purposes of searching and matching.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Character Sequences</th><th>Special Meaning</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>.</code></td><td>is a special character that matches any single character. Using concatenation, we can make regular expressions like <code>a.b</code>, which matches any three-character string that begins with <code>a</code> and ends with <code>b</code>.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>is not a construct by itself; it is a suffix that means that the preceding regular expression is to be repeated as many times as possible. In <code>fo*</code>, the <code> <em></code> applies to the <code>o</code>, so <code>fo</em></code> matches <code>f</code> followed by any number of <code>o</code>'s. The case of zero <code>o</code>'s is allowed: <code>fo*</code> does match <code>f</code>. <code> <em></code> always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding expression. Thus, <code>fo</em></code> has a repeating <code>o</code>, not a repeating <code>fo</code>. The matcher processes a <code> <em></code> construct by matching, immediately, as many repetitions as can be found. Then it continues with the rest of the pattern. If that fails, it backtracks, discarding some of the matches of the <code></em></code>'d construct in case that makes it possible to match the rest of the pattern. For example, matching <code>c[ad]<em>ar</code> against the string <code>caddaar</code>, the <code>[ad]</em></code> first matches <code>addaa</code>, but this does not allow the next <code>a</code> in the pattern to match. So the last of the matches of <code>[ad]</code> is undone and the following <code>a</code> is tried again. Now it succeeds.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>+</code></td><td><code>+</code> is like <code>*</code> except that at least one match for the preceding pattern is required for <code>+</code>. Thus, <code>c[ad]+r</code> does not match <code>cr</code> but does match anything else that <code>c[ad]*r</code> would match.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>?</code></td><td><code>?</code> is like <code>*</code> except that it allows either zero or one match for the preceding pattern. Thus, <code>c[ad]?r</code> matches <code>cr</code> or <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code>, and nothing else.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>[ ... ]</code></td><td><code>[</code> begins a <em>character set</em>, which is terminated by a <code>]</code>. In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets form the set. Thus, <code>[ad]</code> matches either <code>a</code> or <code>d</code>, and <code>[ad]*</code> matches any string of <code>a</code>'s and <code>d</code>'s (including the empty string), from which it follows that <code>c[ad]*r</code> matches <code>car</code>, etc.<br>Character ranges can also be included in a character set, by writing two characters with a <code>-</code> between them. Thus, <code>[a-z]</code> matches any lower-case letter. Ranges may be intermixed freely with individual characters, as in <code>[a-z$%.]</code>, which matches any lower case letter or <code>$</code>, <code>%</code> or period.<br> Note that the usual special characters are not special any more inside a character set. A completely different set of special characters exists inside character sets: <code>]</code>, <code>-</code> and <code>^</code>.<br> To include a <code>]</code> in a character set, you must make it the first character. For example, <code>[]a]</code> matches <code>]</code> or <code>a</code>. To include a <code>-</code>, you must use it in a context where it cannot possibly indicate a range: that is, as the first character, or immediately after a range.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>[^...]</code></td><td><code>[^</code> begins a <em>complement character set</em>, which matches any character except the ones specified. Thus, <code>[^a-z0-9A-Z]</code> matches all characters <em>except</em> letters and digits.<br><code>^</code> is not special in a character set unless it is the first character. The character following the <code>^</code> is treated as if it were first (it may be a <code>-</code> or a <code>]</code>).</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>^</code></td><td>is a special character that matches the empty string -- but only if at the beginning of the string being matched. Otherwise it fails to match anything. Thus, <code>^foo</code> matches a <code>foo</code> which occurs at the beginning of the string.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>$</code></td><td>is similar to <code>^</code> but matches only at the <em>end</em> of the string. Thus, <code>xx*$</code> matches a string of one or more <code>x</code>'s at the end of the string.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%</code></td><td>has two functions: it quotes the above special characters (including <code>%</code>), and it introduces additional special constructs.<br> Because <code>%</code> quotes special characters, <code>%$</code> is a regular expression that matches only <code>$</code>, and <code>%[</code> is a regular expression that matches only <code>[</code>, and so on.<br> For the most part, <code>%</code> followed by any character matches only that character. However, there are several exceptions: characters that, when preceded by <code>%</code>, are special constructs. Such characters are always ordinary when encountered on their own.<br> No new special characters will ever be defined. All extensions to the regular expression syntax are made by defining new two-character constructs that begin with <code>%</code>.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%|</code></td><td>specifies an alternative. Two regular expressions a and b with <code>%</td><td></code> in between form an expression that matches anything that either a or b will match.<br> Thus, <code>foo%</td><td>bar</code> matches either <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code> but no other string.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%</td><td></code> applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions. Only a surrounding <code>%( ... %)</code> grouping can limit the grouping power of <code>%</td><td></code>.<br> Full backtracking capability exists for when multiple <code>%</td><td></code>'s are used.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%( ... %)</code></td><td>is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:<br> * To enclose a set of <code>%|</code> alternatives for other operations. Thus, <code>%(foo%|bar%)x</code> matches either <code>foox</code> or <code>barx</code>.<br> * To enclose a complicated expression for a following <code> <em></code>, <code>+</code>, or <code>?</code> to operate on. Thus, <code>ba%(na%)</em></code> matches <code>bananana</code>, etc., with any number of <code>na</code>'s, including none.<br> * To mark a matched substring for future reference.<br> This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a parenthetical grouping; it is a separate feature that happens to be assigned as a second meaning to the same <code>%( ... %)</code> construct because there is no conflict in practice between the two meanings. Here is an explanation of this feature:</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>----------------------</td><td>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</td><td>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%digit</code></td><td>After the end of a <code>%( ... %)</code> construct, the matcher remembers the beginning and end of the text matched by that construct. Then, later on in the regular expression, you can use <code>%</code> followed by digit to mean "match the same text matched by the digit'th <code>%( ... %)</code> construct in the pattern." The <code>%( ... %)</code> constructs are numbered in the order that their <code>%(</code>'s appear in the pattern.<br> The strings matching the first nine <code>%( ... %)</code> constructs appearing in a regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in order of their beginnings. <code>%1</code> through <code>%9</code> may be used to refer to the text matched by the corresponding <code>%( ... %)</code> construct.<br> For example, <code>%(.<em>%)%1</code> matches any string that is composed of two identical halves. The <code>%(.</em>%)</code> matches the first half, which may be anything, but the <code>%1</code> that follows must match the same exact text.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%b</code></td><td>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning or end of a word. Thus, <code>%bfoo%b</code> matches any occurrence of <code>foo</code> as a separate word. <code>%bball%(s%</td><td>%)%b</code> matches <code>ball</code> or <code>balls</code> as a separate word.<br> For the purposes of this construct and the five that follow, a word is defined to be a sequence of letters and/or digits.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%B</code></td><td>matches the empty string, provided it is <em>not</em> at the beginning or end of a word.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%&lt;</code></td><td>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning of a word.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%&gt;</code></td><td>matches the empty string, but only if it is at the end of a word.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%w</code></td><td>matches any word-constituent character (i.e., any letter or digit).</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>%W</code></td><td>matches any character that is not a word constituent.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>

<p>Encrypts (hashes) the given text using the standard UNIX encryption method. If provided, salt should be a string at least two characters long, and it may dictate a specific algorithm to use. By default, crypt uses the original, now insecure, DES algorithm. ToastStunt specifically includes the BCrypt algorithm (identified by salts that start with "$2a$"), and may include MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 algorithms depending on the libraries used to build the server. The salt used is returned as the first part of the resulting encrypted string.</p>
<p>Aside from the possibly-random input in the salt, the encryption algorithms are entirely deterministic. In particular, you can test whether or not a given string is the same as the one used to produce a given piece of encrypted text; simply extract the salt from the front of the encrypted text and pass the candidate string and the salt to crypt(). If the result is identical to the given encrypted text, then you`ve got a match.</p>

<p>Warning: The entire salt (of any length) is passed to the operating system`s low-level crypt function. It is unlikely, however, that all operating systems will return the same string when presented with a longer salt.

<p>Return the index-th elements of alist. By default, index will be 1. If index is a list of integers, the returned list will have those elements from alist. This is the built-in equivalent of LambdaCore's $list_utils:slice verb.</p>
<p>If alist is a list of maps, index can be a string indicating a key to return from each map in alist.</p>

<p>If natural sort order is true, strings containing multi-digit numbers will consider those numbers to be a single character. So, for instance, this means that 'x2' would come before 'x11' when sorted naturally because 2 is less than 11. This argument defaults to 0.</p>
<p>If reverse is true, the sort order is reversed. This argument defaults to 0.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Creates and returns a new object whose parent (or parents) is parent (or parents) and whose owner is as described below.</p>
<p>Creates and returns a new object whose parents are parents (or whose parent is parent) and whose owner is as described below. If any of the given parents are not valid, or if the given parent is neither valid nor #-1, then E_INVARG is raised. The given parents objects must be valid and must be usable as a parent (i.e., their <code>a</code> or <code>f</code> bits must be true) or else the programmer must own parents or be a wizard; otherwise E_PERM is raised. Furthermore, if anon-flag is true then <code>a</code> must be true; and, if anon-flag is false or not present, then <code>f</code> must be true. Otherwise, E_PERM is raised unless the programmer owns parents or is a wizard. E_PERM is also raised if owner is provided and not the same as the programmer, unless the programmer is a wizard.</p>
<p>After the new object is created, its initialize verb, if any, is called. If init-args were given, they are passed as args to initialize. The new object is assigned the least non-negative object number that has not yet been used for a created object. Note that no object number is ever reused, even if the object with that number is recycled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This is not strictly true, especially if you are using ToastCore and the <code>$recycler</code>, which is a great idea. If you don't, you end up with extremely high object numbers. However, if you plan on reusing object numbers you need to consider this carefully in your code. You do not want to include object numbers in your code if this is the case, as object numbers could change. Use corified references instead. For example, you can use <code>@corify #objnum as $my_object</code> and then be able to reference $my_object in your code. Alternatively you can do <code>@prop $sysobj.my_object #objnum</code>. If the object number ever changes, you can change the reference without updating all of your code.)</p>

<p>Note: $sysobj is typically #0. Though it can technically be changed to something else, there is no reason that the author knows of to break from convention here.</p>

<p>If anon-flag is false or not present, the new object is a permanent object and is assigned the least non-negative object number that has not yet been used for a created object. Note that no object number is ever reused, even if the object with that number is recycled.</p>
<p>If anon-flag is true, the new object is an anonymous object and is not assigned an object number. Anonymous objects are automatically recycled when they are no longer used.</p>
<p>The owner of the new object is either the programmer (if owner is not provided), the new object itself (if owner was given and is invalid, or owner (otherwise).</p>

The initial value of every inherited property is clear; see the description of the built-in function clear_property() for details.</p>
<p>If the intended owner of the new object has a property named <code>ownership_quota</code> and the value of that property is an integer, then create() treats that value as a quota. If the quota is less than or equal to zero, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and create() raises E_QUOTA instead of creating an object. Otherwise, the quota is decremented and stored back into the <code>ownership_quota</code> property as a part of the creation of the new object.</p>

<p>If object is not valid, or if new-parent is neither valid nor equal to <code>#-1</code>, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. If the programmer is neither a wizard or the owner of object, or if new-parent is not fertile (i.e., its <code>f</code> bit is not set) and the programmer is neither the owner of new-parent nor a wizard, then <code>E_PERM</code> is raised. If new-parent is equal to <code>object</code> or one of its current ancestors, <code>E_RECMOVE</code> is raised. If object or one of its descendants defines a property with the same name as one defined either on new-parent or on one of its ancestors, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised.</p>
<p>Changing an object's parent can have the effect of removing some properties from and adding some other properties to that object and all of its descendants (i.e., its children and its children's children, etc.). Let common be the nearest ancestor that object and new-parent have in common before the parent of object is changed. Then all properties defined by ancestors of object under common (that is, those ancestors of object that are in turn descendants of common) are removed from object and all of its descendants. All properties defined by new-parent or its ancestors under common are added to object and all of its descendants. As with <code>create()</code>, the newly-added properties are given the same permission bits as they have on new-parent, the owner of each added property is either the owner of the object it's added to (if the <code>c</code> permissions bit is set) or the owner of that property on new-parent, and the value of each added property is <em>clear</em>; see the description of the built-in function <code>clear_property()</code> for details. All properties that are not removed or added in the reparenting process are completely unchanged.</p>
<p>If new-parent is equal to <code>#-1</code>, then object is given no parent at all; it becomes a new root of the parent/child hierarchy. In this case, all formerly inherited properties on object are simply removed.</p>
<p>If new-parents is equal to {}, then object is given no parent at all; it becomes a new root of the parent/child hierarchy. In this case, all formerly inherited properties on object are simply removed.</p>

<p>The given object is destroyed, irrevocably. The programmer must either own object or be a wizard; otherwise, <code>E_PERM</code> is raised. If object is not valid, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. The children of object are reparented to the parent of object.

<p>After object is recycled, if the owner of the former object has a property named <code>ownership_quota</code> and the value of that property is a integer, then <code>recycle()</code> treats that value as a <em>quota</em> and increments it by one, storing the result back into the <code>ownership_quota</code> property.</p>

<h2 id="object-movement"><a class="header" href="#object-movement">Object Movement</a></h2>
<h3 id="function-move"><a class="header" href="#function-move">Function: <code>move</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>none move(obj what, obj where [, INT position])
</code></pre>
<p>Changes what's location to be where.</p>
<p>This is a complex process because a number of permissions checks and notifications must be performed. The actual movement takes place as described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>what should be a valid object and where should be either a valid object or <code>#-1</code> (denoting a location of 'nowhere'); otherwise <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. The programmer must be either the owner of what or a wizard; otherwise, <code>E_PERM</code> is raised.</p>
<p>If where is a valid object, then the verb-call</p>
<pre><code>where:accept(what)
</code></pre>
<p>is performed before any movement takes place. If the verb returns a false value and the programmer is not a wizard, then where is considered to have refused entrance to what; <code>move()</code> raises <code>E_NACC</code>. If where does not define an <code>accept</code> verb, then it is treated as if it defined one that always returned false.</p>
<p>If moving what into where would create a loop in the containment hierarchy (i.e., what would contain itself, even indirectly), then <code>E_RECMOVE</code> is raised instead.</p>
<p>The <code>location</code> property of what is changed to be where, and the <code>contents</code> properties of the old and new locations are modified appropriately. Let old-where be the location of what before it was moved. If old-where is a valid object, then the verb-call</p>
<pre><code>old-where:exitfunc(what)
</code></pre>
<p>is performed and its result is ignored; it is not an error if old-where does not define a verb named <code>exitfunc</code>. Finally, if where and what are still valid objects, and where is still the location of what, then the verb-call</p>
<pre><code>where:enterfunc(what)
</code></pre>
<p>is performed and its result is ignored; again, it is not an error if where does not define a verb named <code>enterfunc</code>.</p>
<p>Passing <code>position</code> into move will effectively listinsert() the object into that position in the .contents list.</p>

If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the property in question, then <code>set_property_info()</code> raises <code>E_PERM</code>. Property info has the following form:</p>
<pre><code>{owner, perms [, new-name]}

<p>where owner is an object, perms is a string containing only characters from the set <code>r</code>, <code>w</code>, and <code>c</code>, and new-name is a string; new-name is never part of the value returned by <code>property_info()</code>, but it may optionally be given as part of the value provided to <code>set_property_info()</code>. This list is the kind of value returned by property_info() and expected as the third argument to <code>set_property_info()</code>; the latter function raises <code>E_INVARG</code> if owner is not valid, if perms contains any illegal characters, or, when new-name is given, if prop-name is not defined directly on object or new-name names an existing property defined on object or any of its ancestors or descendants.</p>

If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the property in question, then <code>is_clear_property()</code> (<code>clear_property()</code>) raises <code>E_PERM</code>.</p>
<p>If a property is clear, then when the value of that property is queried the value of the parent's property of the same name is returned.

<h2 id="operations-on-verbs"><a class="header" href="#operations-on-verbs">Operations on Verbs</a></h2>
<h3 id="function-verbs"><a class="header" href="#function-verbs">Function: <code>verbs</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>list verbs(obj object)
</code></pre>
<p>Returns a list of the names of the verbs defined directly on the given object, not inherited from its parent</p>
<p>If object is not valid, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. If the programmer does not have read permission on object, then <code>E_PERM</code> is raised.</p>
<p>Most of the remaining operations on verbs accept a string containing the verb's name to identify the verb in question. Because verbs can have multiple names and because an object can have multiple verbs with the same name, this practice can lead to difficulties. To most unambiguously refer to a particular verb, one can instead use a positive integer, the index of the verb in the list returned by <code>verbs()</code>, described above.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that <code>verbs(#34)</code> returns this list:</p>
<pre><code>{"foo", "bar", "baz", "foo"}
</code></pre>
<p>Object <code>#34</code> has two verbs named <code>foo</code> defined on it (this may not be an error, if the two verbs have different command syntaxes). To refer unambiguously to the first one in the list, one uses the integer 1; to refer to the other one, one uses 4.</p>
<p>In the function descriptions below, an argument named verb-desc is either a string containing the name of a verb or else a positive integer giving the index of that verb in its defining object's <code>verbs()</code> list.
For historical reasons, there is also a second, inferior mechanism for referring to verbs with numbers, but its use is strongly discouraged. If the property <code>$server_options.support_numeric_verbname_strings</code> exists with a true value, then functions on verbs will also accept a numeric string (e.g., <code>"4"</code>) as a verb descriptor. The decimal integer in the string works more-or-less like the positive integers described above, but with two significant differences:</p>
<p>The numeric string is a <em>zero-based</em> index into <code>verbs()</code>; that is, in the string case, you would use the number one less than what you would use in the positive integer case.</p>
<p>When there exists a verb whose actual name looks like a decimal integer, this numeric-string notation is ambiguous; the server will in all cases assume that the reference is to the first verb in the list for which the given string could be a name, either in the normal sense or as a numeric index.</p>
<p>Clearly, this older mechanism is more difficult and risky to use; new code should only be written to use the current mechanism, and old code using numeric strings should be modified not to do so.</p>

For <code>verb_code()</code>, the expressions in the returned code are usually written with the minimum-necessary parenthesization; if full-paren is true, then all expressions are fully parenthesized.</p>
<p>Also for <code>verb_code()</code>, the lines in the returned code are usually not indented at all; if indent is true, each line is indented to better show the nesting of statements.</p>
<p>If object is not valid, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. If object does not define a verb as specified by verb-desc, then <code>E_VERBNF</code> is raised. If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then <code>verb_code()</code> (<code>set_verb_code()</code>) raises <code>E_PERM</code>. If the programmer is not, in fact. a programmer, then <code>E_PERM</code> is raised.</p>
<p>For <code>set_verb_code()</code>, the result is a list of strings, the error messages generated by the MOO-code compiler during processing of code. If the list is non-empty, then <code>set_verb_code()</code> did not install code; the program associated with the verb in question is unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="function-disassemble"><a class="header" href="#function-disassemble">Function: <code>disassemble</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>list disassemble(obj object, str|int verb-desc)

<p>Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal "compiled" form of the verb as specified by verb-desc on object</p>
<p>This format is not documented and may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of <code>disassemble()</code> interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.</p>
<p>If object is not valid, then <code>E_INVARG</code> is raised. If object does not define a verb as specified by verb-desc, then <code>E_VERBNF</code> is raised. If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then <code>disassemble()</code> raises <code>E_PERM</code>.</p>

<p>If value is true, then object gains (or keeps) "player object" status: it will be an element of the list returned by <code>players()</code>, the expression <code>is_player(object)</code> will return true, and the server will treat a call to <code>$do_login_command()</code> that returns object as logging in the current connection.</p>
<p>If value is false, the object loses (or continues to lack) "player object" status: it will not be an element of the list returned by <code>players()</code>, the expression <code>is_player(object)</code> will return false, and users cannot connect to object by name when they log into the server. In addition, if a user is connected to object at the time that it loses "player object" status, then that connection is immediately broken, just as if <code>boot_player(object)</code> had been called (see the description of <code>boot_player()</code> below).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="server-commands-and-database-assumptions"><a class="header" href="#server-commands-and-database-assumptions">Server Commands and Database Assumptions</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes all of the commands that are built into the server and every property and verb in the database specifically accessed by the server. Aside from what is listed here, no assumptions are made by the server concerning the contents of the database.</p>
<h2 id="command-lines-that-receive-special-treatment"><a class="header" href="#command-lines-that-receive-special-treatment">Command Lines That Receive Special Treatment</a></h2>
<p>As was mentioned in the chapter on command parsing, there are a number of commands and special prefixes whose interpretation is fixed by the server. Examples include the flush command and the five intrinsic commands (PREFIX, OUTPUTPREFIX, SUFFIX, OUTPUTSUFFIX, and .program).</p>
<p>This section discusses all of these built-in pieces of the command-interpretation process in the order in which they occur.</p>
<h3 id="flushing-unprocessed-input"><a class="header" href="#flushing-unprocessed-input">Flushing Unprocessed Input</a></h3>
<p>It sometimes happens that a user changes their mind about having typed one or more lines of input and would like to <code>untype</code> them before the server actually gets around to processing them. If they react quickly enough, they can type their connection`s defined flush command; when the server first reads that command from the network, it immediately and completely flushes any as-yet unprocessed input from that user, printing a message to the user describing just which lines of input were discarded, if any.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine point: The flush command is handled very early in the server`s processing of a line of input, before the line is entered into the task queue for the connection and well before it is parsed into words like other commands. For this reason, it must be typed exactly as it was defined, alone on the line, without quotation marks, and without any spaces before or after it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a connection is first accepted by the server, it is given an initial flush command setting taken from the current default. This initial setting can be changed later using the set_connection_option() command.</p>
<p>By default, each connection is initially given <code>.flush</code> as its flush command. If the property $server_options.default_flush_command exists, then its value overrides this default. If $server_options.default_flush_command is a non-empty string, then that string is the flush command for all new connections; otherwise, new connections are initially given no flush command at all.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-band-processing"><a class="header" href="#out-of-band-processing">Out-of-Band Processing</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to compile the server to recognize an out-of-band prefix and an out-of-band quoting prefix for input lines. These are strings that the server will check for at the beginning of every unflushed line of input from a non-binary connection, regardless of whether or not a player is logged in and regardless of whether or not reading tasks are waiting for input on that connection.</p>
<p>This check can be disabled entirely by setting connection option "disable-oob", in which case none of the rest of this section applies, i.e., all subsequent unflushed lines on that connection will be available unchanged for reading tasks or normal command parsing.</p>
<h3 id="quoted-lines"><a class="header" href="#quoted-lines">Quoted Lines</a></h3>
<p>We first describe how to ensure that a given input line will not be processed as an out-of-band command.</p>
<p>If a given line of input begins with the defined out-of-band quoting prefix (<code>#$"</code> by default), that prefix is stripped. The resulting line is then available to reading tasks or normal command parsing in the usual way, even if said resulting line now happens to begin with either the out-of-band prefix or the out-of-band quoting prefix.</p>
<p>For example, if a player types</p>
<pre><code>#$"#$#mcp-client-set-type fancy
</code></pre>
<p>the server would behave exactly as if connection option "disable-oob" were set true and the player had instead typed</p>
<pre><code>#$#mcp-client-set-type fancy
</code></pre>
<h3 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h3>
<p>If a given line of input begins with the defined out-of-band prefix (<code>#$#</code> by default), then it is not treated as a normal command or given as input to any reading task. Instead, the line is parsed into a list of words in the usual way and those words are given as the arguments in a call to $do_out_of_band_command().</p>
<p>If this verb does not exist or is not executable, the line in question will be completely ignored.</p>
<p>For example, with the default out-of-band prefix, the line of input</p>
<pre><code>#$#mcp-client-set-type fancy
</code></pre>
<p>would result in the following call being made in a new server task:</p>
<pre><code>$do_out_of_band_command("#$#mcp-client-set-type", "fancy")
</code></pre>
<p>During the call to $do_out_of_band_command(), the variable player is set to the object number representing the player associated with the connection from which the input line came. Of course, if that connection has not yet logged in, the object number will be negative. Also, the variable argstr will have as its value the unparsed input line as received on the network connection.</p>
<p>Out-of-band commands are intended for use by advanced client programs that may generate asynchronous events of which the server must be notified. Since the client cannot, in general, know the state of the player`s connection (logged-in or not, reading task or not), out-of-band commands provide the only reliable client-to-server communications channel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc854.html">Telnet IAC</a> commands will also get captured and passed, as binary strings, to a <code>do_out_of_band_command</code> verb on the listener.</p>
<h3 id="command-output-delimiters"><a class="header" href="#command-output-delimiters">Command-Output Delimiters</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: This is a deprecated feature</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every MOO network connection has associated with it two strings, the <code>output prefix</code> and the <code>output suffix</code>. Just before executing a command typed on that connection, the server prints the output prefix, if any, to the player. Similarly, just after finishing the command, the output suffix, if any, is printed to the player. Initially, these strings are not defined, so no extra printing takes place.</p>
<p>The <code>PREFIX</code> and <code>SUFFIX</code> commands are used to set and clear these strings. They have the following simple syntax:</p>
<pre><code>PREFIX  output-prefix
SUFFIX  output-suffix
</code></pre>
<p>That is, all text after the command name and any following spaces is used as the new value of the appropriate string. If there is no non-blank text after the command string, then the corresponding string is cleared. For compatibility with some general MUD client programs, the server also recognizes <code>OUTPUTPREFIX</code> as a synonym for <code>PREFIX</code> and <code>OUTPUTSUFFIX</code> as a synonym for <code>SUFFIX</code>.</p>
<p>These commands are intended for use by programs connected to the MOO, so that they can issue MOO commands and reliably determine the beginning and end of the resulting output. For example, one editor-based client program sends this sequence of commands on occasion:</p>
<pre><code>PREFIX &gt;&gt;MOO-Prefix&lt;&lt;
SUFFIX &gt;&gt;MOO-Suffix&lt;&lt;
@list object:verb without numbers
PREFIX
SUFFIX
</code></pre>
<p>The effect of which, in a ToastCore-derived database, is to print out the code for the named verb preceded by a line containing only <code>&gt;&gt;MOO-Prefix&lt;&lt;</code> and followed by a line containing only <code>&gt;&gt;MOO-Suffix&lt;&lt;</code>. This enables the editor to reliably extract the program text from the MOO output and show it to the user in a separate editor window. There are many other possible uses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: If the command thus bracketed calls suspend(), its output will be deemed “finished” then and there; the suffix thus appears at that point and not, as one might expect, later when the resulting background task has finally returned from its top-level verb call. Thus, use of this feature (which was designed before suspend() existed) is no longer recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The built-in function <code>output_delimiters()</code> can be used by MOO code to find out the output prefix and suffix currently in effect on a particular network connection.</p>
<h2 id="the-program-command"><a class="header" href="#the-program-command">The .program Command</a></h2>
<p>The <code>.program</code> command is a common way for programmers to associate a particular MOO-code program with a particular verb. It has the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>.program object:verb
...several lines of MOO code...
.
</code></pre>
<p>That is, after typing the <code>.program</code> command, then all lines of input from the player are considered to be a part of the MOO program being defined. This ends as soon as the player types a line containing only a dot (<code>.</code>). When that line is received, the accumulated MOO program is checked for proper MOO syntax and, if correct, associated with the named verb.</p>
<p>If, at the time the line containing only a dot is processed, (a) the player is not a programmer, (b) the player does not have write permission on the named verb, or (c) the property <code>$server_options.protect_set_verb_code</code> exists and has a true value and the player is not a wizard, then an error message is printed and the named verb's program is not changed.</p>
<p>In the <code>.program</code> command, object may have one of three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of some object visible to the player. This is exactly like the kind of matching done by the server for the direct and indirect objects of ordinary commands. See the chapter on command parsing for details. Note that the special names <code>me</code> and <code>here</code> may be used.</li>
<li>An object number, in the form <code>#number</code>.</li>
<li>A <em>system property</em> (that is, a property on <code>#0</code>), in the form <code>$name</code>. In this case, the current value of <code>#0.name</code> must be a valid object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="initial-punctuation-in-commands"><a class="header" href="#initial-punctuation-in-commands">Initial Punctuation in Commands</a></h2>
<p>The server interprets command lines that begin with any of the following characters specially:</p>
<pre><code>"        :        ;
</code></pre>
<p>Before processing the command, the initial punctuation character is replaced by the corresponding word below, followed by a space:</p>
<pre><code>say      emote    eval
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the command line</p>
<pre><code>"Hello, there.
</code></pre>
<p>is transformed into</p>
<pre><code>say Hello, there.
</code></pre>
<p>before parsing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="server-assumptions-about-the-database"><a class="header" href="#server-assumptions-about-the-database">Server Assumptions About the Database</a></h1>
<p>There are a small number of circumstances under which the server directly and specifically accesses a particular verb or property in the database. This section gives a complete list of such circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="server-options-set-in-the-database"><a class="header" href="#server-options-set-in-the-database">Server Options Set in the Database</a></h2>
<p>Many optional behaviors of the server can be controlled from within the database by creating the property <code>#0.server_options</code> (also known as <code>$server_options</code>), assigning as its value a valid object number, and then defining various properties on that object. At a number of times, the server checks for whether the property <code>$server_options</code> exists and has an object number as its value. If so, then the server looks for a variety of other properties on that <code>$server_options</code> object and, if they exist, uses their values to control how the server operates.</p>
<p>The specific properties searched for are each described in the appropriate section below, but here is a brief list of all of the relevant properties for ease of reference:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you override a default value that was defined in options.h (such as no_name_lookup or finished_tasks_limit, or many others) you will need to call <code>load_server_options()</code> for your changes to take affect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Verbs defined on #0 are not longer subject to the wiz-only permissions check on built-in functions generated by defining $server_options.protect_FOO with a true value. Thus, you can now write a `wrapper' for a built-in function without having to re-implement all of the server's built-in permissions checks for that function.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If a built-in function FOO has been made wiz-only (by defining $server_options.protect_FOO with a true value) and a call is made to that function from a non-wiz verb not defined on #0 (that is, if the server is about to raise E_PERM), the server first checks to see if the verb #0:bf_FOO exists. If so, it calls it instead of raising E_PERM and returns or raises whatever it returns or raises.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: options.h #defines IGNORE_PROP_PROTECTED by default. If it is defined, the server ignores all attempts to protect built-in properties (such as $server_options.protect_location). Protecting properties is a significant performance hit, and most MOOs do not use this functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="server-messages-set-in-the-database"><a class="header" href="#server-messages-set-in-the-database">Server Messages Set in the Database</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of circumstances under which the server itself generates messages on network connections. Most of these can be customized or even eliminated from within the database. In each such case, a property on <code>$server_options</code> is checked at the time the message would be printed. If the property does not exist, a default message is printed. If the property exists and its value is not a string or a list containing strings, then no message is printed at all. Otherwise, the string(s) are printed in place of the default message, one string per line. None of these messages are ever printed on an outbound network connection created by the function <code>open_network_connection()</code>.</p>
<p>The following list covers all of the customizable messages, showing for each the name of the relevant property on <code>$server_options</code>, the default message, and the circumstances under which the message is printed:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Default Message</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>boot_msg = "*** Disconnected ***"</td><td>The function boot_player() was called on this connection.</td></tr>

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine point: If the network connection in question was received at a listening point (established by the <code>listen()</code> function) handled by an object obj other than <code>#0</code>, then system messages for that connection are looked for on <code>obj.server_options</code>; if that property does not exist, then <code>$server_options</code> is used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checkpointing-the-database"><a class="header" href="#checkpointing-the-database">Checkpointing the Database</a></h2>
<p>The server maintains the entire MOO database in main memory, not on disk. It is therefore necessary for it to dump the database to disk if it is to persist beyond the lifetime of any particular server execution. The server is careful to dump the database just before shutting down, of course, but it is also prudent for it to do so at regular intervals, just in case something untoward happens.</p>
<p>//TODO: is the date here still true in 64bit time?</p>
<p>To determine how often to make these <em>checkpoints</em> of the database, the server consults the value of <code>$server_options.dump_interval</code>. If it exists and its value is an integer greater than or equal to 60, then it is taken as the number of seconds to wait between checkpoints; otherwise, the server makes a new checkpoint every 3600 seconds (one hour). If the value of <code>$server_options.dump_interval</code> implies that the next checkpoint should be scheduled at a time after 3:14:07 a.m. on Tuesday, January 19, 2038, then the server instead uses the default value of 3600 seconds in the future.</p>
<p>The decision about how long to wait between checkpoints is made again immediately after each one begins. Thus, changes to <code>$server_options.dump_interval</code> will take effect after the next checkpoint happens.</p>
<p>Whenever the server begins to make a checkpoint, it makes the following verb call:</p>
<pre><code>$checkpoint_started()
</code></pre>
<p>When the checkpointing process is complete, the server makes the following verb call:</p>
<pre><code>$checkpoint_finished(success)
</code></pre>
<p>where success is true if and only if the checkpoint was successfully written on the disk. Checkpointing can fail for a number of reasons, usually due to exhaustion of various operating system resources such as virtual memory or disk space. It is not an error if either of these verbs does not exist; the corresponding call is simply skipped.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="networking"><a class="header" href="#networking">Networking</a></h1>
<h2 id="accepting-and-initiating-network-connections"><a class="header" href="#accepting-and-initiating-network-connections">Accepting and Initiating Network Connections</a></h2>
<p>When the server first accepts a new, incoming network connection, it is given the low-level network address of computer on the other end. It immediately attempts to convert this address into the human-readable host name that will be entered in the server log and returned by the <code>connection_name()</code> function. This conversion can, for the TCP/IP networking configurations, involve a certain amount of communication with remote name servers, which can take quite a long time and/or fail entirely. While the server is doing this conversion, it is not doing anything else at all; in particular, it it not responding to user commands or executing MOO tasks.</p>
<p>By default, the server will wait no more than 5 seconds for such a name lookup to succeed; after that, it behaves as if the conversion had failed, using instead a printable representation of the low-level address. If the property <code>name_lookup_timeout</code> exists on <code>$server_options</code> and has an integer as its value, that integer is used instead as the timeout interval.</p>
<p>When the <code>open_network_connection()</code> function is used, the server must again do a conversion, this time from the host name given as an argument into the low-level address necessary for actually opening the connection. This conversion is subject to the same timeout as in the in-bound case; if the conversion does not succeed before the timeout expires, the connection attempt is aborted and <code>open_network_connection()</code> raises <code>E_QUOTA</code>.</p>
<p>After a successful conversion, though, the server must still wait for the actual connection to be accepted by the remote computer. As before, this can take a long time during which the server is again doing nothing else. Also as before, the server will by default wait no more than 5 seconds for the connection attempt to succeed; if the timeout expires, <code>open_network_connection()</code> again raises <code>E_QUOTA</code>. This default timeout interval can also be overridden from within the database, by defining the property <code>outbound_connect_timeout</code> on <code>$server_options</code> with an integer as its value.</p>
<h2 id="associating-network-connections-with-players"><a class="header" href="#associating-network-connections-with-players">Associating Network Connections with Players</a></h2>
<p>When a network connection is first made to the MOO, it is identified by a unique, negative object number. Such a connection is said to be <em>un-logged-in</em> and is not yet associated with any MOO player object.</p>
<p>Each line of input on an un-logged-in connection is first parsed into words in the usual way (see the chapter on command parsing for details) and then these words are passed as the arguments in a call to the verb <code>$do_login_command()</code>. For example, the input line</p>
<pre><code>connect Munchkin frebblebit
</code></pre>
<p>would result in the following call being made:</p>
<pre><code>$do_login_command("connect", "Munchkin", "frebblebit")
</code></pre>
<p>In that call, the variable <code>player</code> will have as its value the negative object number associated with the appropriate network connection. The functions <code>notify()</code> and <code>boot_player()</code> can be used with such object numbers to send output to and disconnect un-logged-in connections. Also, the variable <code>argstr</code> will have as its value the unparsed command line as received on the network connection.</p>
<p>If <code>$do_login_command()</code> returns a valid player object and the connection is still open, then the connection is considered to have <em>logged into</em> that player. The server then makes one of the following verbs calls, depending on the player object that was returned:</p>
<pre><code>$user_created(player)
$user_connected(player)
$user_reconnected(player)
</code></pre>
<p>The first of these is used if the returned object number is greater than the value returned by the <code>max_object()</code> function before <code>$do_login_command()</code> was invoked, that is, it is called if the returned object appears to have been freshly created. If this is not the case, then one of the other two verb calls is used. The <code>$user_connected()</code> call is used if there was no existing active connection for the returned player object. Otherwise, the <code>$user_reconnected()</code> call is used instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fine point: If a user reconnects and the user's old and new connections are on two different listening points being handled by different objects (see the description of the <code>listen()</code> function for more details), then <code>user_client_disconnected</code> is called for the old connection and <code>user_connected</code> for the new one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If any code suspends in do_login_command() or a verb called by do_login_command() (read(), suspend(), or any threaded function), you can no longer connect an object by returning it. This is a weird ancient MOO holdover. The best way to log a player in after suspending is to use the <code>switch_player()</code> function to switch their unlogged in negative object to their player object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If an in-bound network connection does not successfully log in within a certain period of time, the server will automatically shut down the connection, thereby freeing up the resources associated with maintaining it. Let L be the object handling the listening point on which the connection was received (or <code>#0</code> if the connection came in on the initial listening point). To discover the timeout period, the server checks on <code>L.server_options</code> or, if it doesn't exist, on <code>$server_options</code> for a <code>connect_timeout</code> property. If one is found and its value is a positive integer, then that's the number of seconds the server will use for the timeout period. If the <code>connect_timeout</code> property exists but its value isn't a positive integer, then there is no timeout at all. If the property doesn't exist, then the default timeout is 300 seconds.</p>
<p>When any network connection (even an un-logged-in or outbound one) is terminated, by either the server or the client, then one of the following two verb calls is made:</p>
<pre><code>$user_disconnected(player)
$user_client_disconnected(player)
</code></pre>
<p>The first is used if the disconnection is due to actions taken by the server (e.g., a use of the <code>boot_player()</code> function or the un-logged-in timeout described above) and the second if the disconnection was initiated by the client side.</p>
<p>It is not an error if any of these five verbs do not exist; the corresponding call is simply skipped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Only one network connection can be controlling a given player object at a given time; should a second connection attempt to log in as that player, the first connection is unceremoniously closed (and <code>$user_reconnected()</code> called, as described above). This makes it easy to recover from various kinds of network problems that leave connections open but inaccessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the network connection is first established, the null command is automatically entered by the server, resulting in an initial call to <code>$do_login_command()</code> with no arguments. This signal can be used by the verb to print out a welcome message, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: If there is no <code>$do_login_command()</code> verb defined, then lines of input from un-logged-in connections are simply discarded. Thus, it is <em>necessary</em> for any database to include a suitable definition for this verb.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that a database with a missing or broken $do_login_command may still be accessed (and perhaps repaired) by running the server with the -e command line option. See section Emergency Wizard Mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to compile the server with an option defining an <code>out-of-band prefix</code> for commands. This is a string that the server will check for at the beginning of every line of input from players, regardless of whether or not those players are logged in and regardless of whether or not reading tasks are waiting for input from those players. If a given line of input begins with the defined out-of-band prefix (leading spaces, if any, are <em>not</em> stripped before testing), then it is not treated as a normal command or as input to any reading task. Instead, the line is parsed into a list of words in the usual way and those words are given as the arguments in a call to <code>$do_out_of_band_command()</code>. For example, if the out-of-band prefix were defined to be <code>#$#</code>, then the line of input</p>
<pre><code>#$# client-type fancy
</code></pre>
<p>would result in the following call being made in a new server task:</p>
<pre><code>$do_out_of_band_command("#$#", "client-type", "fancy")
</code></pre>
<p>During the call to <code>$do_out_of_band_command()</code>, the variable <code>player</code> is set to the object number representing the player associated with the connection from which the input line came. Of course, if that connection has not yet logged in, the object number will be negative. Also, the variable <code>argstr</code> will have as its value the unparsed input line as received on the network connection.</p>
<p>Out-of-band commands are intended for use by fancy client programs that may generate asynchronous <em>events</em> of which the server must be notified. Since the client cannot, in general, know the state of the player's connection (logged-in or not, reading task or not), out-of-band commands provide the only reliable client-to-server communications channel.</p>
<h2 id="player-input-handlers"><a class="header" href="#player-input-handlers">Player Input Handlers</a></h2>
<p><strong>$do_out_of_band_command</strong></p>
<p>On any connection for which the connection-option disable-oob has not been set, any unflushed incoming lines that begin with the out-of-band prefix will be treated as out-of-band commands, meaning that if the verb $do_out_of_band_command() exists and is executable, it will be called for each such line. For more on this, see Out-of-band Processing.</p>
<p><strong>$do_command</strong></p>
<p>As we previously described in The Built-in Command Parser, on any logged-in connection that</p>
<ul>
<li>is not the subject of a read() call,</li>
<li>does not have a .program command in progress, and</li>
<li>has not had its connection option hold-input set,</li>
</ul>
<p>any incoming line that</p>
<ul>
<li>has not been flushed</li>
<li>is in-band (i.e., has not been consumed by out-of-band processing) and</li>
<li>is not itself .program or one of the other four intrinsic commands</li>
</ul>
<p>will result in a call to $do_command() provided that verb exists and is executable. If this verb suspends or returns a true value, then processing of that line ends at this point, otherwise, whether the verb returned false or did not exist in the first place, the remainder of the builtin parsing process is invoked.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-first-tasks-run-by-the-server"><a class="header" href="#the-first-tasks-run-by-the-server">The First Tasks Run By the Server</a></h1>
<p>Whenever the server is booted, there are a few tasks it runs right at the beginning, before accepting connections or getting the value of $server_options.dump_interval to schedule the first checkpoint (see below for more information on checkpoint scheduling).</p>
<p>First, the server calls $do_start_script() and passes in script content via the args built-in variable. The script content is specified on the command line when the server is started. The server can call this verb multiple times, once each for the -c and -f command line arguments.</p>
<p>Next, the server calls $user_disconnected() once for each user who was connected at the time the database file was written; this allows for any cleaning up that<code>s usually done when users disconnect (e.g., moving their player objects back to some</code>home` location, etc.).</p>
<p>Next, it checks for the existence of the verb $server_started(). If there is such a verb, then the server runs a task invoking that verb with no arguments and with player equal to #-1. This is useful for carefully scheduling checkpoints and for re-initializing any state that is not properly represented in the database file (e.g., re-opening certain outbound network connections, clearing out certain tables, etc.).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="controlling-the-execution-of-tasks"><a class="header" href="#controlling-the-execution-of-tasks">Controlling the Execution of Tasks</a></h1>
<p>As described earlier, in the section describing MOO tasks, the server places limits on the number of seconds for which any task may run continuously and the number of “ticks,” or low-level operations, any task may execute in one unbroken period. By default, foreground tasks may use 60,000 ticks and five seconds, and background tasks may use 30,000 ticks and three seconds. These defaults can be overridden from within the database by defining any or all of the following properties on $server_options and giving them integer values:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>bg_seconds</td><td>The number of seconds allotted to background tasks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>bg_ticks</td><td>The number of ticks allotted to background tasks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fg_seconds</td><td>The number of seconds allotted to foreground tasks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fg_ticks</td><td>The number of ticks allotted to foreground tasks.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The server ignores the values of <code>fg_ticks</code> and <code>bg_ticks</code> if they are less than 100 and similarly ignores <code>fg_seconds</code> and <code>bg_seconds</code> if their values are less than 1. This may help prevent utter disaster should you accidentally give them uselessly-small values.</p>
<p>Recall that command tasks and server tasks are deemed <em>foreground</em> tasks, while forked, suspended, and reading tasks are defined as <em>background</em> tasks. The settings of these variables take effect only at the beginning of execution or upon resumption of execution after suspending or reading.</p>
<p>The server also places a limit on the number of levels of nested verb calls, raising <code>E_MAXREC</code> from a verb-call expression if the limit is exceeded. The limit is 50 levels by default, but this can be increased from within the database by defining the <code>max_stack_depth</code> property on <code>$server_options</code> and giving it an integer value greater than 50. The maximum stack depth for any task is set at the time that task is created and cannot be changed thereafter. This implies that suspended tasks, even after being saved in and restored from the DB, are not affected by later changes to $server_options.max_stack_depth.</p>
<p>Finally, the server can place a limit on the number of forked or suspended tasks any player can have queued at a given time. Each time a <code>fork</code> statement or a call to <code>suspend()</code> is executed in some verb, the server checks for a property named <code>queued_task_limit</code> on the programmer. If that property exists and its value is a non-negative integer, then that integer is the limit. Otherwise, if <code>$server_options.queued_task_limit</code> exists and its value is a non-negative integer, then that's the limit. Otherwise, there is no limit. If the programmer already has a number of queued tasks that is greater than or equal to the limit, <code>E_QUOTA</code> is raised instead of either forking or suspending. Reading tasks are affected by the queued-task limit.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="controlling-the-handling-of-aborted-tasks"><a class="header" href="#controlling-the-handling-of-aborted-tasks">Controlling the Handling of Aborted Tasks</a></h1>
<p>The server will abort the execution of tasks for either of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>an error was raised within the task but not caught</li>
</ol>
<p>In each case, after aborting the task, the server attempts to call a particular <em>handler verb</em> within the database to allow code there to handle this mishap in some appropriate way. If this verb call suspends or returns a true value, then it is considered to have handled the situation completely and no further processing will be done by the server. On the other hand, if the handler verb does not exist, or if the call either returns a false value without suspending or itself is aborted, the server takes matters into its own hands.</p>
<p>First, an error message and a MOO verb-call stack <em>traceback</em> are printed to the player who typed the command that created the original aborted task, explaining why the task was aborted and where in the task the problem occurred. Then, if the call to the handler verb was itself aborted, a second error message and traceback are printed, describing that problem as well. Note that if the handler-verb call itself is aborted, no further 'nested' handler calls are made; this policy prevents what might otherwise be quite a vicious little cycle.</p>
<p>The specific handler verb, and the set of arguments it is passed, differs for the two causes of aborted tasks.</p>
<p>If an error is raised and not caught, then the verb-call</p>
<pre><code>$handle_uncaught_error(code, msg, value, traceback, formatted)
</code></pre>
<p>is made, where code, msg, value, and traceback are the values that would have been passed to a handler in a <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> statement and formatted is a list of strings being the lines of error and traceback output that will be printed to the player if <code>$handle_uncaught_error</code> returns false without suspending.</p>
<p>If a task runs out of ticks or seconds, then the verb-call</p>
<pre><code>$handle_task_timeout(resource, traceback, formatted)
</code></pre>
<p>is made, where <code>resource</code> is the appropriate one of the strings <code>"ticks"</code> or <code>"seconds"</code>, and <code>traceback</code> and <code>formatted</code> are as above.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="matching-in-command-parsing"><a class="header" href="#matching-in-command-parsing">Matching in Command Parsing</a></h1>
<p>In the process of matching the direct and indirect object strings in a command to actual objects, the server uses the value of the <code>aliases</code> property, if any, on each object in the contents of the player and the player's location. For complete details, see the chapter on command parsing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="restricting-access-to-built-in-properties-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#restricting-access-to-built-in-properties-and-functions">Restricting Access to Built-in Properties and Functions</a></h1>
<p><strong>Protected Properties</strong></p>
<p>A built-in property prop is deemed protected if $server_options.protect_prop exists and has a true value. However, no such property protections are recognized if the compilation option IGNORE_PROP_PROTECTED (see section Server Compilation Options) was set when building the server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In previous versions of the server enabling this has significant performance costs, but that has been resolved with caching lookups, and thus this option is enabled by default in ToastStunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever verb code attempts to read (on any object) the value of a built-in property that is protected in this way, the server raises E_PERM if the programmer is not a wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Protected Built-in Functions</strong></p>
<p>A built-in function func() is deemed protected if $server_options.protect_func exists and has a true value. If, for a given protected built-in function, a corresponding verb $bf_func() exists and its <code>x</code> bit is set, then that built-in function is also considered overridden, meaning that any call to func() from any object other than #0 will be treated as a call to $bf_func() with the same arguments, returning or raising whatever that verb returns or raises.</p>
<p>A call to a protected built-in function that is not overridden proceeds normally as long as either the caller is #0 or has wizard permissions; otherwise the server raises E_PERM.</p>
<p>Note that you must call load_server_options() in order to ensure that changes made in $server_options take effect.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-and-recycling-objects"><a class="header" href="#creating-and-recycling-objects">Creating and Recycling Objects</a></h1>
<p>Whenever the <code>create()</code> function is used to create a new object, that object's <code>initialize</code> verb, if any, is called with no arguments. The call is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, just before the <code>recycle()</code> function actually destroys an object, the object's <code>recycle</code> verb, if any, is called with no arguments. Again, the call is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.</p>
<p>Both <code>create()</code> and <code>recycle()</code> check for the existence of an <code>ownership_quota</code> property on the owner of the newly-created or -destroyed object. If such a property exists and its value is an integer, then it is treated as a <em>quota</em> on object ownership. Otherwise, the following two paragraphs do not apply.</p>
<p>The <code>create()</code> function checks whether or not the quota is positive; if so, it is reduced by one and stored back into the <code>ownership_quota</code> property on the owner. If the quota is zero or negative, the quota is considered to be exhausted and <code>create()</code> raises <code>E_QUOTA</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>recycle()</code> function increases the quota by one and stores it back into the <code>ownership_quota</code> property on the owner.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="object-movement-1"><a class="header" href="#object-movement-1">Object Movement</a></h1>
<p>During evaluation of a call to the <code>move()</code> function, the server can make calls on the <code>accept</code> and <code>enterfunc</code> verbs defined on the destination of the move and on the <code>exitfunc</code> verb defined on the source. The rules and circumstances are somewhat complicated and are given in detail in the description of the <code>move()</code> function.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="temporarily-enabling-obsolete-server-features"><a class="header" href="#temporarily-enabling-obsolete-server-features">Temporarily Enabling Obsolete Server Features</a></h1>
<p>If the property <code>$server_options.support_numeric_verbname_strings</code> exists and has a true value, then the server supports a obsolete mechanism for less ambiguously referring to specific verbs in various built-in functions. For more details, see the discussion given just following the description of the <code>verbs()</code> function.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="signals-to-the-server"><a class="header" href="#signals-to-the-server">Signals to the Server</a></h1>
<p>The server is able to intercept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)">signals</a> from the operating system and perform certain actions, a list of which can be found below. Two signals, USR1 and USR2, can be processed from within the MOO database. When SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 is received, the server will call <code>#0:handle_signal()</code> with the name of the signal as the only argument. If this verb returns a true value, it is assumed that the database handled it and no further action is taken. If the verb returns a negative value, the server will proceed to execute the default action for that signal. The following is a list of signals and their default actions:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Signal</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>HUP</td><td>Panic the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ILL</td><td>Panic the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>QUIT</td><td>Panic the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SEGV</td><td>Panic the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>BUS</td><td>Panic the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>INT</td><td>Cleanly shut down the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TERM</td><td>Cleanly shut down the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td>USR1</td><td>Reopen the log file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>USR2</td><td>Schedule a checkpoint to happen as soon as possible.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>For example, imagine you're a system administrator logged into the machine running the MOO. You want to shut down the MOO server, but you'd like to give players the opportunity to say goodbye to one another rather than immediately shutting the server down. You can do so by intercepting a signal in the database and invoking the @shutdown command.</p>
<pre><code>@prog #0:handle_signal
set_task_perms(caller_perms());
{signal} = args;
if (signal == "SIGUSR2" &amp;&amp; !$code_utils:task_valid($wiz_utils.shutdown_task))
  force_input(#2, "@shutdown in 1 Shutdown signal received.");
  force_input(#2, "yes");
  return 1;
endif
.
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can signal the MOO with the kill command: <code>kill -USR2 &lt;MOO process ID</code></p>
